- [ ] Shopen 2007 OR 1985 "Language typology and syntactic description"
		Suggested during Field Methods as a complement to Describing Morphosyntax.
		Includes a chapter by Talmy (definitely in 1985; check whether 2007 version is retained) suggested by Nick "Lexical Typologies". Possibly in Volume 3.
		This is 3 volumes and each is 500 pages. Good to load for field readings as per Laura's suggestions, but for reading expect it to take long and include targeted readings. Be gentle.
