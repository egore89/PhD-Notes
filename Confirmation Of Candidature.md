## Introduction
- Namo, Yam languages, Southern New Guinea
	- Brief literature review
	- 

- Worth mentioning in the "justification for this project" or "work I've already done" parts is the additions I have to nominal morphology
	- /-ro/ restrictive paradigm
	- questions around the /-ot/ allative suffix with the example
		- worth asking Nick first though
## My project
- Grammar
- Dictionary
- Any other materials requested by the community
- Current analysis
	- Phonology
	- Nominal morphology
		- I have some things to add to the current sources
			- privative suffix
			- plural suffix
				- /jimmi-ve/ is interesting
			- -> Maybe not much that was unexpected
	- Verbal morphology



## Why do we need a grammar of another Yam language?

- Namo has features that elucidate historical changes and processes
	- retroflex consonants (with Len and Namat)
	- an alternation in dual marking on verbs (c.f. [[Dohler 2018]])
	- This is what I'm looking for in descriptions of other Nambu/Yam languages, and also in the data I've collected already

- The people of Tais want someone to work on their language
	- Still not entirely clear on the differences/similarities of Tais and Mari dialects
		- I have a percentage of cognates/same words that's around 75%
	- Nobody has visited Tais or collected data from there
- The language is still vital, but with <400 speakers it is not entirely stable. 
	- ESPECIALLY given climate change
		- References for:
			- Sea level rises -> Has it risen in the Torres Strait already? If not, in the Pacific/Australia? -> How much has it risen?
			- Adverse weather events rising in Torres Strait, or Northern Australia
				- Yaoga was destroyed by a cyclone (according to [[PhD_Notes/Readings/Evans et al 2017]]) and the language has mostly disappeared
					- BECAUSE language use is tied to place ([[PhD_Notes/Readings/Anthropology Readings/Ayres 1983]], [[Dohler 2018]]), and so Namo may die out even if the people who speak it don't; all it would take is for all of them to move to a new place and the language would stop being spoken. 

- PhD projects change regularly, and while I'm determined to write a grammar of Namo, I have a few ideas for how this project may change
	- Ideal: I will produce a grammar of Namo with data from Mari and Tais, clarifying the language situation and discovering some interesting grammatical features to justify the project.
	- BUT: in Tais they also speak Len, which has a number of features that are interesting 
		- Retroflex consonants
		- something morphological on the verbs
		- l/n correspondences with other Nambu languages
	- THEREFORE: the project may change, and may indeed be more valuable as a "language situation of Tais" kind of vibe
		- In this case I may produce a smaller grammar of Namo as spoken in Tais, a larger academic document on Len, and sociocultural materials such as dictionaries of Namo and/or Len, depending on which would be most satisfactory to the people in Tais
			- I do not expect them to be excited by the prospect of a linguistic grammar
- THUS: it is highly valuable that data be considered from Tais. In all the work being done, it is a corner of Yam languages that clearly includes some very interesting phenomena, and I think it is worth my time to shine a light
	- kind of cleaning up the corners of the room, before everybody leaves for 'more interesting' parts of PNG


- I'm really interested in the language ecology of Tais itself.
	- From NE I have that they speak Na (namo) and Len, due to the movement of people from Yaoga to Tais in the 1970s. 
	- [[PhD_Notes/Readings/Anthropology Readings/Ayres 1983]] places the boundary between Namo and Lan (Len) in a space that seems to be between Tais and Mari.
	- A map on page 124 (10) of [[PhD_Notes/Readings/Historical Linguistic Descriptions/Wurm 1971]] groups Tais and Mari together as speaking Dorro, but also includes Nambu into Tais. Page 126 (12) states that Tais is a 'Nambu-Dorro transition dialect'. Mari is listed as speaking Dorro.
		- This map also places Bimadebun as speaking Idi. 
	- SIL report from 2006 states that people in Mari identify Tais as mostly (but not entirely) the same as their own language, 3 out of possible 4 in similarity.
	- [[PhD_Notes/Readings/Anthropology Readings/Williams 1936]] places a village 'Doro' very far north in the region.
- -> some of these questions aren't very useful to questions of "how did the area get to be so linguistically diverse?" or "how did Yam languages develop" but they are very interesting to questions of "what do linguistically diverse communities look like" or even "what did communities maybe look like in the past"
	- The problem is that these questions aren't addressed by a linguistic grammar. 


# Presentation

- I want to have a slide or more showing comparisons between my data and historical wordlists, suggesting that Namo is more likely Parb than Dorro
- Two slides on historical reconstructions of Yam languages, one for retroflexes and one for dental fricative

### Slides

1. Title slide: A grammar of Namo
2. Table of contents for what's in the talk
3. Introduction to the Background section
4. Yam languages overview, including map
5. Typological overview of Eastern Yam languages: SOV argument order (mostly), erg/abs, no gender, 3x number distinction, complex nominal and verbal morphologies.
6. Word order. Examples from Namo: "I'm making a canoe" and "she (already) washed her child"
7. Erg/abs case alignment system. May need evidence from Nama/Nen to show that nominals, not just pronouns/proper names take ergative case.
8. Number distinction. Include paradigms for examples, "work"
9. 4-way number distinction in positionals
10. Nominal morphology. This slide shows the table from Carroll 2020, although I'll have to say that there are different words by different linguists for some of the cases. I'll include Nmbo and Namo data where I can here, as well as the restrictive pronoun /-ro/. 
11. Shows Namo examples of nominal morphology, with examples "Chris saw him", and "I'm running from the crocodile".
12. Verbal morphology. Shows the topics to be shown later: prefixes and suffixes, divided into two verb categories; directional and valency/thematic prefix (optional); Tense/Aspect/Dual suffix. 
13. Shows the ambi-/prefixing verb split intransitive category, and includes examples of all three verb types to show A, S, and P affixes.
14. Thematic TA/dual suffix, and introduces distributed exponence, the most complicated part of Yam morphology.
15. Focuses on distributed exponence, with an example from Namo of what I can parse so far, and the classic Ngkolmpu example.
16. Introductory slide for the Literature Review
17. Naming conventions
18. Literature review groups: pre WW2, mid century, recent/ongoing. 
19. Phase 1, a table showing source and number of words, with the language identifiable or likely to be Namo/Dorro. 
20. Phase 2, a list of sources and major result: morehead upper maro phylum
21. Map from Wurm 1971
22. Phase 3, list of sources including SIL. 
23. Project Overview introduction
24. Desired outputs, list of current data
25. Tentative grammar structure
26. Methodology and analysis
27. Field sites, including a picture from Tais
28. Fieldwork trips, possible contingencies
29. Writing timeline
30. Preliminary Results and Motivation introduction
31. Overview: phonological reconstruction, things I know I don't know, including possible morphological reconstruction. A final section of non-linguistic motivations and points of interest.
32. Phonological reconstruction. As an overview slide, this shows the three retained and two lost phonemes from pY. Includes a quote from Hyman.
33. Retroflex cognate sets
34. Dental fricative cognate sets
35. Rounded bilabial sets
36. Phonological innovations: \*ng>n; \*voicedplosives>prenasalised/fricatives
37. Introduces what I know I don't know: central vowel, positionals, duals
38. Central vowel. Example analyses from Nmbo, Nen, Nama, and further. 
39. Namo examples of central vowels. Cognates with Nen/Nmbo data; examples where the central vowel is clearly unpredictable.
40. Positionals. Show examples from Namo and Nen. Main question is how many there are in Namo; include rough estimates from related languages.
41. Dual number. Particularly complex in Yam languages. I have clear evidence of the thematic suffix, and of stem alternation. 
42. Shows the questions remaining. ?prefix in /tie two things/ /w-/? (as opposed to the other 'you two tie one thing'). ?infix? in "am talking". 
43. The Language Situation of Tais and Mari introduction slide
