- Need to organise my Readings folder of pdfs better
- Need to organise my Zotero libraries better
	- Different libraries for different categories of readings
		- Anthropology
		- Grammars
			- Examples of grammars as theses to guide my own writing
				- Dohler and Siegel are published grammars, and may not have all the elements required for a thesis
		- General Linguistics
		- Theories?
		- etc...
- Rosey Billington's phd was written in latex
- Need to mention if I'm using any writing from LING9032 in my thesis
	- Somewhere online ANU has guidelines about this. Maybe the LING9032 page?
