Syncing obsidian costs about $150 australian per year. $100 US. It's not a huge cost, in the scheme of things, but it's every year for the rest of my life. Or as long as I want to synchronise files across multiple devices using obsidian. Maybe it'll be worth it. Or maybe I'm wasting my time learning to use Obsidian if I don't want to pay to sync across devices. Or maybe in the future I can just use my home device because that's all I'll need. Or all I'll need for the life of each device, which will change when I change devices. Can I save Obsidian files to a portable hard drive? Probably. If we can save it to dropbox then definitely. But apparently these hard drives only last around 3-5 years. Which is as long as a regular computer. What? 
Great. Now I'm distracted by cloud storage options and decisions.
