Started learning about knowledge management systems / second brains / notetaking software.
- Seems like Obsidian might be good for me. Worth trying for a few days/weeks.
- Problems might occur with syncing across devices. One of the videos I watched had a plugin that can help with that.
- My main goal in using a software rather than writing stuff in books is the ability to search my notes in the cases where I want to come back to notes later. Excel is not designed to take long chunks of text. Primarily this is for taking notes within readings, which is supposed to keep me engaged with the reading while I'm doing it.  

Zettelkasten method is a method of note-taking and knowledge management.
