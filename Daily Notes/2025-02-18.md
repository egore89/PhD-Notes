- Could be a good idea to look through Nick and Jeff's corpora on PARADISEC and see what kinds of texts they've collected. 
	- Ideas for elicitation and what to get people to talk about
- I think I need to think or learn more about reading; its purpose, goals, theory. For me it takes a huge amount of time and I don't remember anything. 
	- Could this be due to not being able to identify/distinguish between significant and insignificant points? 
	- Maybe I need to establish a goal for the reading before I start, a goal that can be updated as I read. Also acknowledge that some things need to be read a few times. 
	- Accept? Or acknowledge? that some readings are to learn by rote different things.
		- e.g. paradigms in certain languages Nama, Nen, Nmbo, etc...
	- [[Thoughts about reading as a practice]]

- One thing that I think I struggle with in learning a new language is trying to say things in the language I'm learning as I would in English. We can't say "c'est pour quand ces cafes" in English, but neither can we say "hey are we getting those coffees today or what?" in French, but we *can* portray the sass and discontent and indicate we want those coffees now please and hurry up in both languages. 
	- Perhaps it might be good to think about English sentences and learn a bit about English grammar.
