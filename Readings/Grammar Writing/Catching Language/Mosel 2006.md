# Questions

- This came up a number of times while reading the introduction to this book.
- What is the art of grammar writing?
- I believe this has a section called 'typology of grammars'

	- Theory and practice \*
	- The role of texts in grammars
- Perspectives of description: semasiological and onomasiological approaches \*
	- investigate and describe the semantic properties of linguistic forms (semasiological)
	- OR describe the ways particular meanings are expressed (onomasiological)
- Concluding remarks

# Notes (author's ideas)

- Grammars are written because humans are interested in how language works
	- this leads to theories and generalisations, by way of questions such as "if this is how it works in this language, how does it work in other languages?"


- a reader must know which linguistic forms are present in a language before they can learn how those forms map onto certain meanings.


# Cues (my ideas)

- From the typology here I'm trying to write a grammar that is:
	- probably a dialect/non-standard grammar, since the language hasn't been standardised
	- bilingual, a description in English of Namo
	- descriptive
	- passive -> describe the grammar from the hearer's perspective, providing analysis of sentences to understand grammatical categories and constructions
	- for linguistics
	- going to have a meta-linguistic purpose -> for linguistic typology and theory building

- Haspelmath 2002 a reference to check out
	- "the only exception \[to the statement that interlinear glossing hasn't received attention in textbooks on grammatical analysis]"

- "the meaning of words and larger units of grammatical analysis does not equal the sum of the meanings of their component parts...but results from the <u>interaction</u> of the meaning of the construction as such **and** the meanings of its parts.
	- -> interaction of the meaning of the whole and the meanings of its parts

- "the content of reference grammars reflects special interests of the authors and/or editors, and prevalent topics in current linguistic theories"
	- what are my grammatical special interests?
	- what are the prevalent topics in current linguistic theories?
		- -> "there are certain types of grammatical phenomena \[the] knowledge of which is essential for the understanding of a language." -> both as a language learner and a theoretician
			- sound system and orthography
			- simple declarative, interrogative, and imperative clauses
			- word groups (nominals, NPs, verb complexes)
			- formal features indicating syntactic functions. -> case marking, cross-referencing
			- classification of major word classes ???
			- inflectional paradigms and meanings of grammatical categories ???

- Comrie and Smith 1977 Lingua Descriptive Series Questionnaire contains typological categories for cross-linguistic analysis. 
	- ? are these categories still used in more recent typology literature?



# Summary

In this chapter the author outlines their perspectives on grammar writing, comparing the process with that of writing a dictionary. It begins with the author's assessment of the different ways a grammar may be structured and written. The focus is what should be included and how structured in a grammar, with short descriptions of data collection methods and analysis. It concludes with an overview of the major dichotomy in grammatical description, that of linguistic form and function, and whether a grammar should prioritise describing the forms and how they are used, or in describing how different functional categories are expressed by speakers of the language. In writing my own grammar I will need to consider how to describe the forms that carry meaning in Namo in a way that is easily accessible for people without a deep understanding of specific Yam language phenomena. 


This chapter describes the considerations one must make when writing a grammar of a language. This is done as a comparison with the process of writing a dictionary, which is argued as similar in many ways. The chapter begins with several sections discussing some of the specifics of what a grammar may include. Section two contains a list of "typologies" of grammars; areas where grammars may focus on which language and variety they describe, as well as for and by whom the description is written. After a short section touching on data collection and the structure of the grammar, Mosel goes deeper into a discussion of specific questions about the actual content of the grammar.
The second part of the chapter compares in more detail the process of grammar writing with that of dictionary writing. The author makes numerous references to work done in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, outlining the blurry boundary between a language's lexicon and its grammar. Section 6 takes time to detail how grammars may be structured, starting with how they are similar to dictionaries, and then moving on to specific structural questions. Section 7 is particularly interesting as it includes a list of apparent basic phenomena as required knowledge for anyone wanting to learn how a particular language works. 
Section 8 considers the question of form and function in linguistic description. Mosel uses the terms "semasiological" and "onomasiological" perspectives to separate a framework that considers the specific meanings and behaviours exhibited by particular forms, as opposed to basing a description in broader theoretical concepts such as tense, subject/object, or meanings, and describing how those meanings are expressed in the language (respectively). After a description of some of the earliest discussions of these contexts, Mosel describes a series of grammars written with a set of meanings applied to various languages, and ends with a discussion of the problems of this kind of descriptive process. He does close by stating that both approaches - semasiological and onomasiological - are necessary parts of linguistics.
