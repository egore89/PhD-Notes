### To-dos
- "Payne and Weber: Perspectives on Grammar Writing" may be worth looking into. This is a book that's available online.
- 
### Thoughts
- Mosel's chapter "grammaticography" includes a discussion of the different approaches to grammar vis. starting with form and progressing back to concepts like tense and aspect, or starting with broad categories such as tense or aspect and moving in to formal representations in the specific language.
- Section 3.2.2 "Grammar and history": Christian's Komnzo grammar seems to hit some of the points they're talking about here; a synchronic account including diachronic theories, explanations, and perspectives. 
### Phrases that jump out
- capture the essential structural features of a language
- formal linguistic modelling 
- observed grammatical phenomena vs. models of human language 
- formalized models of syntax, phonology, semantics, and other modules of grammar 
- "general comparative grammar" or "basic linguistic theory" 
- a lack of formalism is not incompatible with precision provided that descriptive terms are given rigorous definitions and rules are formulated carefully 
- explanations for patterns in particular languages may lay outside a speaker's linguistic competence, (instead) in the history of the language, (or) in its cultural matrix, (or) in the wider sociolinguistic context in which the given language is only one of a number ... used, or in those aspects of the use of the language which might be described as ... "performance" rather than "competence". 
- Boasian trilogy: grammar, dictionary, texts 


### Questions
- Why am I reading this?
I'm giving this a re-read for my LING9032 assignment. 
I feel this is a decent summary of the challenges of grammar writing, with as little distraction by specifics such as [[20250702_ARCHIVE_Old_Notes/Readings/Grammar Writing/Theoretical frameworks/Haspelmath 2009]] and [[20250702_ARCHIVE_Old_Notes/Readings/Grammar Writing/Theoretical frameworks/Haspelmath 2007]] as possible.

- What information do I need from this reading?
Basically I'm looking for a summary.

- How much time and energy is it worth?
Half a chunk.

### Summary
This chapter provides a detailed overview of the various aspects of grammar writing, as well as an introduction to the book as a whole. The authors provide an introduction to the various subdisciplines most engaged with descriptive grammars, and how these subdisciplines differ and converge in their engagement with grammar writing. The chapter then goes on to discuss the different kinds of materials produced in a broader project of language documentation, of which the descriptive grammar is one part. This is followed by a discussion of grammar writing in the broader context of engaging with the culture that uses the language. The chapter ends with a discussion of where the authors thought grammar writing would go in the future.
