Linguistic typology requires crosslinguistic formal categories.
Newmeyer, Frederick J. 2007


### Questions
- Why am I reading this?
[[PhD_Notes/Readings/Grammar Writing/Theoretical frameworks/Haspelmath 2010]] refers to being a direct response to this article.
Provides a counter to the "no categories exist" arguments of [[PhD_Notes/Readings/Grammar Writing/Theoretical frameworks/Haspelmath 2007]] and [[PhD_Notes/Readings/Grammar Writing/Theoretical frameworks/Haspelmath 2009]]

- What information do I need from this reading?
I'm looking for a summary. 
Is this just about linguistic typology? 
Does it have anything to say about language description?

- How much time and energy is it worth?



### Sections/Chapters

### Notes (author's ideas)

- 3 positions that sets of Formal Categories exist:
	- that can be equated in the grammars of two or more languages
	- that exist for languages to "choose" from, although not all will be manifested in every language
	- that exist in all languages, and whose manifestation may be harder to find
- -> evidence for the first provided in this paper

Section 2
- "\[some] descriptive generalizations that enter into typological analysis <u>need</u> to make reference to cross linguistic formal categories"
- An example: negation (summarizing/discussing the work of Dryer 1992)
	- The claim: typological generalizations should refer to the concept of negation, rather than any formal realizations that might occur cross linguistically
		- some languages use nonverbal particles, some use verbal negatives. This means each might end up in a different category when viewed from a "word order" perspective (and presumably word classes)
		- nonverbal particles may, however, be classed as "verbal patterners", because of how they exhibit some properties similar to other verbs. In this way they are similar to tense/aspect particles. 
			- None of these correlate with the order of verb and object. (what does this even mean? They interrupt verb-object order? They don't relate to one another, or to the verb, in the same way as an object would?)
		- tense/aspect words (is he distinguishing between 'word' and 'particle'?) are verb patterners when they exhibit verbal properties
			- therefore we have to consider the form they take, since "verbal properties" are not semantic, but formal. 
			- these formal constructs (including concepts such as auxiliary and particle) must be equal across languages
- Another example: adpositions and case case affixes
	- Case affixes often carry the same grammatical information as adpositions
		- sometimes in the same language, c.f. Icelandic
	- If we classed these based solely on semantic criteria we would pattern these together
		- Which means we might expect VO languages, which usually have prepositions, to have case prefixes. 
		- Indeed, "affix" is difficult to define semantically, as is the concept of a "head" of a construction

Section 3
- Acknowledges that cross linguistic formal categories may be problematic, but argues that universal concepts (or substance, as in [[PhD_Notes/Readings/Grammar Writing/Theoretical frameworks/Haspelmath 2007]]) are also very difficult to define.
	- an example: thematic roles

Section 4
- Structural based typology already acknowledges and has space for variation and uncertainty in definition of terms, and substance based typology does not do away with same. 
- Structural based typology allows for explanations and examinations of a wider range of phenomena that a more substance based typology does not.

Section 5
- "if cross linguistic formal categories do not exist, then two dialects of the same language no more share categories than do two entirely distinct languages. "
	- This could apply to language change as well
- The differences in presentation of a single grammatical category across languages are exaggerated and not large enough to do away with the concept entirely.
	- States that this issue comes from a consequence of applying the "distributional method"
		- "used to identify the basic grammatical units out of which complex syntactic structures are built"
- Formal (typological) syntactic theory is about identifying abstract principles which explain linguistic behaviour in a group of languages. 
	- Accounting for the variation in surface realisation of these principles is a subsidiary (but not primary or the entire) task of this 

Section 6
- languages may present constructions that require the creation of new categories, or at least the consideration of this, but this is more likely to be morphological categories than syntactic categories.

### Cues (my ideas)
- more applicable to typology than to language description, I think

- Typology is inherently interested in what "the majority" do, and always has room for exceptions and outliers. The search for patterns does not preclude the existence of things that do not fit the pattern.
	- But is this true? Some statements about universal grammar, for example, do claim to be universal. Are those taken seriously? I believe they are.
	- But I guess that's the final answer, isn't it. Everyone's saying it, and the answer is that there must be flexibility and space for things not to fit. 
		- Have we given up on a universal theory of how languages work? Is such even possible? How much reading would I need to do to understand that, and do I really want to do that?

- Doesn't really explain what the distributional method is, how it works, or how it causes one to overexaggerate the differences in how a single concept may arise in different languages.

### Summary

In this chapter Newmeyer argues that there is a need for formal linguistic categories, especially in the work of comparing and grouping languages by their behaviour (typology). The primary way this is done is by rejecting the alternative suggested by sources claiming that formal categories do not exist, namely that categorisations must be made based on more semantic or substantial criteria, rather than the linguistic forms a language uses. Newmeyer draws on examples such as word order typology to illustrate that structural categories such as subject/object and auxiliary are the best ways we have to group languages with similar behaviour, and that trying to group these phenomena according to more semantic or meaning based criteria does not work. Newmeyer also points out that structural categories are used even by those arguing they do not exist.
