Pre-established categories don't exist: Consequences for language description and typology
Haspelmath 2007
### Questions
- Why am I reading this?
The title piques my interest. 
If categories don't exist, how do we describe a language? How do we do typology
	- What does he mean by category?

- What information do I need from this reading?
What is the primary argument Haspelmath is making here?
How does that argument compare and relate do that of [[Haspelmath 2009]]

- How much time and energy is it worth?
Maybe an hour, since I plan to use it for [[Assessment]] 1 in LING9032. A deep read for sure.

### Notes (author's ideas)

- structural categories like clitic, affix, compound, adjective, pronoun, dative, subject, passive, diphthong, coronal.
	- There is no discrete list of these to "choose" from in each language
		- As more description is being done this list does not get shorter
- categories are not universal, but substance is
- 


### Cues (my ideas)

- structural (i.e. formal) categories
- Claims that questions like "Is German *er* a pronoun or determiner" or "Is the Romanian definite article a clitic or a suffix" (c.f. Icelandic, or English) are pointless, and instead each phenomenon must be described in as much detail as possible. But even imperfect fits are still fits. Yam languages may not have a concrete distinction between present, past, and future, but does this stop us from thinking about "tense in Yam languages"?
- section 2 lists some typologies of various constructions which could be interesting.

### Summary

This article argues that linguistic categories cannot be assumed to exist in a language, and discusses the implications of this for language description and linguistic typology. Haspelmath starts by establishing that these categories are not established outside of a particular language, that is that they are not established in some biological fashion in the brain. He goes on to argue that the structural categories often used in typology - including such concepts as affix and clitic, as well as noun and verb - do not exist, since a consequence of the ever growing understanding of how individual languages work seems only to increase the numbers of these categories. 
The major consequence for language description is that all the grammatical phenomena described in a language must be described in as much detail, and without relying on prior expectations as much as possible. The largest problem described is of what to call these phenomena, where the advice is to use the names applied to the very categories argued not to exist, but to do so in a way as to express that this is a description that applies only to the language in question. 

In this article Haspelmath lays out his argument against the existence of established cross-linguistic categories. He provides arguments based on controversies surrounding how constructions in a number of example languages don't quite fit into any accepted categories. He goes on to advise how to proceed in both language description and typological efforts. As regards linguistic description, however, he acknowledges that the names of at least some of these categories are best used as labels for the described phenomena, so long as it is made clear that this presentation is particular to the language being described. He emphasises clear, detailed descriptions of each phenomenon in a language description, and states that a describer must avoid bringing prior expectations or assumptions about how languages are structured into their work.
