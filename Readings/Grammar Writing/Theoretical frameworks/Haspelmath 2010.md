Technically after [[Haspelmath 2009]] since that was the 2nd edition of that book.


- Descriptive categories
	- grammatical categories applicable to particular languages
		- or language families?
	- language-particular
- Comparative concepts
	- crosslinguistic comparison, created by typologists for the purpose of comparison
	- linguist-specific in that each linguist (typologist) is free to define their own concepts
- "At least as theoretical linguistics, we are not satisfied with getting the facts (regarding how a language works) right, but we also want to gain insights into the inner workings of the language, into the way its various elements cohere." p. 667/6
	- He's talking here about how a Noun in one language may not directly relate to a Noun in another. Or more clearly, the Dative in one language vs in another. By meeting a language on its own terms we are trying to get at the almost symbolic relationship between the forms a language speaker uses and the concepts the forms are to portray.
- Seems to me an argument can be made that we're not against grammatical concepts in languages per se, but that we're arguing that the evidence and criteria for assigning a word or construction to a certain category must come from the language itself.

### Questions
- Why am I reading this?
Separates "descriptive" categories from "comparative" concepts. 
I'm writing a descriptive grammar, so I'm looking for an understanding of descriptive categories

- What information do I need from this reading?
What does the author say/advise regarding descriptive categories

- How much time and energy is it worth?

### Sections/Chapters

1. Introduction: How to compare languages
2. Typologists use comparative concepts
3. Descriptive linguists use language-particular descriptive categories
4. Cross linguistic categories cannot be the basis for comparative linguistics
5. Examples of comparative concepts
6. Terminology: what to call comparative concepts and descriptive categories
7. Earlier approaches to comparison of grammars
8. Choosing the best comparative concepts
9. Comparative concepts are not linguistic categories
10. Conclusion

### Notes (author's ideas)

- grammatical categories are not for typologists to define, but for descriptivists, and then only in the individual language being described.
- An example of a comparative concept:
	- "A dative case is a morphological marker that has among its functions the coding of the recipient argument of a physical transfer verb (such as 'give', 'lend', 'send', 'hand'), when this is coded differently from the theme argument.

Section 3
- 'description' here may correspond to 'analysis'
- Categories are necessary since the alternative is a list of all possible sentences and forms.
- In order to assign linguistic forms to a category one must develop criteria for entry to that category. If done at an individual-language level this is possible, but at a cross linguistic level the criteria are almost endless, and whichever are chosen will be biased in some way by the one choosing them. 

Section 6
- Comparative concepts are linguist specific, while descriptive categories are language specific
	- Not true, since the application of words like "dative" and "middle verb" are extremely subjective
	- Haspelmath's solution is to take conceptual terms such as dative and specify them by language
		- the Icelandic Dative is different from the Namo Dative
		- How does this work in Yam languages, where every description has a different way of describing the (arguably) single form? e.g. Dative, Instrumental.
			- How much should I define and describe my reasoning for choosing one term over another?

### Cues (my ideas)

- I feel like this is the conclusion: descriptive categories are different from comparative concepts, and that the world of typology has moved forward in acceptance of using concepts and discussing how those concepts are categorised across languages. 
- Section 3 contains a discussion of phonological problems in this way as well, and includes a number of references that might be worth considering as background to defining phonemes in Namo. TODO.


### Summary
This article defines the difference between cross linguistic concepts and language specific structural categories. The focus is on advising the definitions of the former, however there is also advice on defining the latter which is most useful for my own research. These categories must be defined by the linguist when describing an undescribed language, and Haspelmath considers a number of ways of doing this.
