Framework-Free Grammatical Theory

- opposes Basic Linguistic Theory
- "Frameworks set up expectations about what phenomena a language should, can, and cannot have, and once a framework has been adopted, it is hard to free oneself from the perspective and the constraints imposed by it." p. 288/19
- 3 kinds of frameworks
	- restrictive frameworks
	- functional frameworks
	- Basic Linguistic Theory

- Fundamental concepts
	- Grammatical theory = theory of morphosyntax
	- Framework 
		- aka descriptive framework or theoretical framework
		- a sophisticated and complex metalanguage for linguistic description intended to work for any language
	- Theory
		- Four senses
			1. the sense of "descriptive framework" as the metalanguage for describing languages
				- Optimality theory
				- Government-Binding theory
				- Basic Linguistic theory
			2. an abstract model or description of a complex empirical domain
			3. a set of coherent hypotheses or claims about a particular phenomenon
			4. referring to "non-applied" scientific work, or "theorising"
				- usage-based theory
				- valency theory
		- Basically, by "framework-free" he means "metalanguage/theory free"
			- "...in this chapter \[the author] discuss theorizing about morphosyntactic phenomena that makes no use of descriptive frameworks (complex metalanguages)"
	- Description
		- the characterization of grammatical regularities of particular languages
			- requires some abstract entities since "it is not possible to describe a language by listing all its sentences".
	- Analysis
		- synonymous to description, tied to those abstract entities.


- A framework is difficult to devise without including bias from another language
	- even if possible, the framework introduces bias to descriptive work
	- "A metalanguage by definition provides a preestablished set of expressions with a certain meaning, and by limiting ourselves to such a metalanguage, we would not be able to do justice to a language whose system does not correspond exactly to the concepts provided by the metalanguage."

- two most prominent functional frameworks
	- Functional Grammar
	- Role and Reference Grammar (RRG)
- Assume a set of universal categories, but not that these concepts are innate to all languages.
	- i.e. not a restrictive framework

### Reference leads

- Mielke, Jeff 2008 *The Emergence of Distinctive Features*
	- a discussion as this one but on phonology
	- language particular features in phonology
- \** Van Valin, R.D., Jr 2005 *Exploring the Syntax-Semantics interface*
	- contains criticism of Chomskyan linguistics for English bias
	- Same author also a chapter of current volume Handbook of Linguistic Analysis
	- Both of these references for Role and Reference Grammar
- Croft William
	- 2001 *Radical construction grammar: syntactic theory in typological perspective*
		- grammatical categories and relations are language-specific
	- 2003 *typology and universals*
		- a good place to start for typology?
- Dryer, Matthew S. 1997 *Are grammatical relations universal*
	- More typology
- Haspelmath, Martin
	- 2007 *Pre-established categories don't exist: consequences for language description and typology*
		- Looks like something worth looking into
	- 2009 *Descriptive categories and comparative concepts in crosslinguistic studies*
		- Quite a lot of Haspelmath references in this book look worth looking at
- Greenberg, Joseph H. 1963 *Universals of language*
	- curious to see what this source from 1963 has to say about universals
- Dik, Simon C. 1997 *The Theory of Functional Grammar*
	- Describes the Functional Grammar functional theoretical framework
	- two volumes
- Butler, Christopher S. 2003 *Structure and Function: A guide to three major structural functional theories*
	- Name speaks for itself
