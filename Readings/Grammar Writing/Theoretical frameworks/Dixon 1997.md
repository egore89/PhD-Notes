The rise and fall of languages
R.M.W. Dixon

- overview notes in Zotero. 
- This note is about my ideas for where to go with reading next
	- concepts
	- theories
- as well as my kind of thoughts on how to incorporate this reading into my wider knowledge and thesis work.




### Thoughts
- p. 117 
	- Myth: "...people with a limited material culture must have a proportionately threadbare language."
	- Truth: The reverse. "Small political groups generally have an intricate social structure with an articulated system of classificatory relationships and communal obligations. (In contrast, the social networks of city dwellers are rudimentary, and could appropriately be described as primitive)."
		- Complex systems of pronouns
		- several number distinctions
			- exclusive/inclusive
- P. 118
	- All languages are roughly equal in terms of overall complexity.
- pp. 124-5 
	- discusses adjective classes
		- a place to think for [[20250702_ARCHIVE_Old_Notes/Working Thesis/Working Thesis overview]] sections is to think about which of these classes adjectives in Namo/Yam languages fall into
			- do these then fit with the typological correlation between head/dependent marking and adjective classes outlined on page 125?
- p. 127
	- "If one simply examines a few dozen languages, all spoken by large communities, nine-tenths of the diversity and complexity of human language will remain undiscovered."
		- The first section of this chapter provides evidence and support for looking at languages spoken by smaller communities, by describing a diversity of characteristics as well as how they (can) develop from or into one another. 
			- A good reference to support linguistic work on languages spoken by small communities.
				- Does the vitality of Namo/Yam languages also come into play here? 
					- Is there a difference between a small community of speakers living among a larger community of speakers? E.g. in a city?
					- as opposed to a small community of speakers living in a discrete contained environment?
					- What about endangerment? Does a language's vitality affect how it is used and exists compared with either a larger or smaller language that is stable?
						- How would one study this?
- p. 131 
	- a footnote lists out a number of "formalist" theories
		- Transformational Grammar
		- Standard Theory
			- Extended Standard Theory
				- Revised Extended Standard Theory
		- Government and Binding Theory
		- Principles and Parameters Theory
		- Tagmemics
		- Scale-and-category Grammar
		- Systemic Grammar
		- Functional Grammar
		- Daughter Dependency Grammar
		- Stratificational Grammar
		- Generative Semantics
		- Relational Grammar
		- Arc-Pair Grammar
		- Lexical Functional Grammar
		- Generalised Phrase Structure Grammar
		- Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar
		- Cognitive Grammar
		- Role and Reference Grammar


I feel the next reading to do on this thought-train is Catching Language
- the chapter on BLT (Dryer)
- introduction
- other chapters that look interesting
