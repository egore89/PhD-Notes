- Some reports (such as 14 in More1972) make references such as "as written by Mr. Kelly". I have also seen "as reported by Mr. Young". In a second reading it would be good to understand what these are referring to. Are they referring to 
	- previous reports?
	- other kinds of reports?
	- parliamentary reports?
- Note the year the report was made, and who the officer/s involved were, then compare to previous reports in the same area. Might take some time.
	- Different officer names seem to correspond to different areas. Mr. Kelly in trans-Fly. Mr. Young in Bensbach. [[PhD_Notes/Readings/Kiap Reports/Kiap Notes/Morehead/More1972]]
