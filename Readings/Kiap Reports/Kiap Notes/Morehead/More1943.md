# More1943
- This scan at UCSD is very bad. Seems to make reference to a village near Boigu, but unable to read name. Possibly further west from Mari.
	- p.7 "12.3.44
	  After attending a coronation anniversary ceremony held by the BOIGU people (ref. ?Sen? ????) a start was made but owing to engine trouble and drifting onto a sand bank it was not until 1030 hrs. that we were properly on our way.
	  A heavy following ??? was experienced on the ??? to ==??? (JARAI?)== where anchor was dropped at 1500? hrs. Owing t the large sandbank and shoals at this point the entire party, ??? crew excepted, did not arrive in the village until well after dark."
	- "13.5.44
	  â€¦
	  The same procedure (mentioned) was also carried out with the village of MARI a few miles to the east, and the party then left for the MOREHEAD river."
	- May be referring to Jarai? The more I look at it the more it looks like Jarai.

	- p.7 15.5.44 Mentions spending the night at YAUGA. ?Yaoga?
	- p.8 (date unclear) Names a "new" village on the west bank of the (unclear) ?Wassi Kusa? river. 

	- pp. 15-17 list villages and include details. This copy too blurred to read.

Appears the patrol went to Boigu, then west to Jarai and Kunji, then back east to ?Yaoga?. 

- p.16 describes ?Moibut? between descriptions of Kunji and Yaoga
	- "...a new village, the people having come from the inland..."
