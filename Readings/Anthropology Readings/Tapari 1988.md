Largely focused on specifics of regional development. Contains an assessment of what is hindering development, but likely this has evolved since 1988. Some useful notes below, but largely confirms what is discussed in other references. 
# Notes

- p.7 Western province divided into 3 census areas: 
	- Saru in the north
	- Bensbach in the west (bordered roughly along the Morehead river)
	- Trans-fly in the east

- p.9 has a map of population distribution in this document. Does not include labels for villages, but the text on p.8 lists "Bula, Jarai, Tais, Mari and Buji" as coastal settlements. 
- Map with labels given on p.10.

- "Traditionally the local people lived in isolated hamlets in family groups which colonial government and missionaries consolidated into larger villages". p. 8
- This has begun to disintegrate (at time of writing). "The resumption of traditional settlement patterns in mainly by family or clan groups". 
	- described further in [[Ayres 1983]] p.17/38

- p.15 lists some factors limiting development. One of note is a 32km "quarantine zone" along the border with Indonesia. No "economic crops and animals" are allowed to be transported out of this zone. I wonder whether this is still the case?
	- p.16 Crops established around Rouku were destroyed when this zone was implemented. ?How far is Tais from the border?
