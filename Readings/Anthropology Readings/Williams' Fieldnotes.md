This was lent to me by Nick to find out more specifically around the Tais village (possibly Tuj in this and [[Williams 1936]]). Find out what I can about where people of what tribes were living, type it up, and prepare it to give to people in Tais when I go.



# Notes
- In Tuj 2. Marked in notes with a piece of paper. 
	- 3 clans:
		- Tudiaplu -> corresponds to Bwabwab or Bangu. Front.
			- Do not eat bananas.
		- Margup -> Nuntakop or Maiawa. Middle. 
			- Do not eat pig.
		- Kwombiu -> Petakwi or Sangara. Rear. 
			- Do not eat Aigaluk, a fish hawk.


Possibly tribe names
- Asingabara
- Keraki
- Karigara
- Jeikar/jenjeram
- Karambo
- Marer
- Babir/babiri
- Torou ?village?
- Bondubondu
- Tonda

Sometimes these are listed as headings alongside the village names where (I assume) the notes and information were given. Sometimes these are given by informants as names or groupings for people. The three clans listed in [[Hitchcock 2010]] appear across the notes.


1st Pass
Marked the pages which mention Tuj and Dorro.
I think it'd be good to get through some more of [[Williams 1936]] and [[Ayres 1983]] and better understand the more polished descriptions of clan vs. tribe vs. village vs. language group. 
These notes seem to be sectioned by which village the information was gathered in. Recurring themes like marriage, clan affiliations, sexuality and practice come up in many places, although not in Tuj.
