I'm looking for suggestions of where tribes lived when Williams was there in the region; which areas of land might belong to which peoples. I'm also reading to get a broad understanding of how people lived in the area, so deep reading for that is probably unnecessary. 

Chapter 3 describes Linguistic areas
- Williams groups [[Ray 1923]]'s Sanana and Parb groups together, numbers 13-19
- ==TODO list out these numbers and see what they correspond to in Ray==
- Dorro on the map in the back falls into group 14 "Karigara". Dorro location appears to correspond with "Upper Morehead" region in Kiap reports, see [[Kiap First Reading Notes]].

Chapter 5 deals with Keraki Tribes. p. 51
- p. 53 describes the Tuj tribe, named after primary village. Tanjue described as "disintegrated", marked as west of Strachan Is.
