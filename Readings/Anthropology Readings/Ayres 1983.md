Reading this to help understand the local lifestyles of people in the Morehead area. Also using this to try and understand people movement, and see if it contains any notes about where people from which tribes lived previously. 

page numbers are marked either:
	PDF. which just refers to the page of the PDF, or
	by a slash / which is the intext document page followed by the PDF page

First reading:
- understand the main goals of the thesis and project
- understand the field site and focus
- skim the thesis to see if Tais, Mari, Yaoga are mentioned
## Preface

- Rouku aka. Tjevethak. p.iii  Precise pronunciation unclear, c.f. [[Dohler 2018]] maybe.
- PDF.7 describes the languages and dialects, showing the dialect chain characteristics
	- "Even they \[the local people] lack comprehension as they travel farther from home to areas where dialect differences become more pronounced."
- PDF.8 describes the languages learned at school, and why Tok Pisin and Hiri Motu are not spoken in this area
	- "Anyone who attended school since the establishment of the government school in 1961 learned English." 
	- Later, talking about working with interpreters: "My interpreters' English was generally good and pleasingly literal."
- Anthropological theory distinguished 2 types of communities (PDF.50)
	- founded on kinship ("primitive") 
	- local contiguity/territory ("civilized")
		- following to pdf. 51 is very interesting outline of the European and Eurocentric understanding of "land" and "ownership" and may lead me to a better understanding of other concepts of connection to land and country.
## Thoughts
- 3 sections
	- Maiwa
	- Sangara
	- Bangu
		- -> does this still apply in Tais today?
- Field notes of various people may be stored in an archive somewhere. PDF. 13 mentions accessing Williams' notes at the archives in PNG.
	- Maybe Ayres' notes are there too now?
- Looking over the table of contents, this whole thesis looks worth reading
	- Chapter 3: The mythical origins of places and people
	- Chapter 4: Places, lands, and the local segmentation of groups \****
	- Chapter 5: Exogamy, marriage exchange, and place
	- Chapter 6: Grave sites and the manner of forgetting the dead
	- Chapter 7: The visible and the real: places, speech and native epistemology

### Chapter 1: Introduction
- Trans-fly refers to the region "beyond the Fly river" from the perspective of Port Moresby
	- Trans-Fly census division encompasses the region between the Morehead and Pahoturi rivers, thus excluding Rouku (which belongs, I believe, to the Bensbach c/d)
	- p.1/22
- Morehead river named after the premier of Queensland, c.1890. p.10-11/31-32
	- administrative headquarters established at Mabadauan in 1890. moved to Daru 1893.
- Vocabulary list of the "Bangu" tribe (tjokwasef dialect speakers, as per Ayres)
	- Annual report for Papua 1895-6, pp. 106-120
- A.P Lyons field journals. Available at UQ, and it appears anyone can book to see them. Available in microform.
- Notable Patrol Officer: Leo Austen. Likely contributed to the Kiap reports.
- Government station established at Rouku in 1951. 
	- Moved to where Morehead station is now in 1959.
		- Good to know for Kiap reports
- Describes the process of consolidating small villages into larger centres by the colonial government, which has been undone since the decline of patrols.
- "Masu" village
	- map on pdf.151 indicates it is near the Morehead river, beteween Rouku (tjevethak) and Morehead station.
- Culture Groups, Languages, and Neighbours p.24/45
	- Names "Tonda" and "Nambu" come from [[Wurm 1971]]
		- Tonda as the place, Nambu as the "dialect name"
		- Ayres refers to branches as languages, and what we call languages as dialects.
	- The process of using the word for "what" as the dialect (language) name in Nambu branch languages comes from "mythical times" in the story of the origin tree. p. 27/48. 

### Chapter 2: Theoretical considerations
- Distinction between community based on 'kinship' or 'consanguinity and affinity', AND those based on local contiguity and territory.
	- kin-based seen as more primitive, territorial based seen as more civilised
		- but what about communities based on language/cultural practices? Do these exist?

### Chapter 4: Places, lands, and the local segmentation of groups
- "group" is a set of people who share a common identity, in relation to other groups of this time. 
	- Based in a large measure on locality. A locality may comprise one or more named locations, or places. pp. 126-7/147-8
- States on pdf.149 that "mbant" (mband in Namo) does not refer to mud.
	- hunting areas are not "mbant". Contrasts with word "kar" (Tonda word) for "place".
- The first few pages of this chapter are worth revisiting TODO. They describe the concepts of place and ground, and give a fair indication of how people from Morehead think of place and land.
- Map pdf. 156 showing language areas. 
	- significantly: 
		- La (in brackets?) covers what must be Tuj, about halfway between wassi kussa river and the border of Nambu/Tonda.
- Dialects mark different localities p.134/155. in Nambu speaking areas.
- p.138/159 and following for a description of what I believe to be the splitting of Nama into Nama and Namat mentioned in [[Christian Dohler 29.1.25]]
- Tabaram village described as uninhabited, with inhabitants moving "southward" to Arufi and Kianjei. p.140/161
- Map on p. 143/164 shows villages and language groups
	- Tuj placed in "La si"
	- Mari placed in "Namo yem"
	- Doro shown further north in "Nemei yem"
- Describes the "conjunction" of the two systems - marriageable sections and dialect groups - in Chapter 5. p. 142/163
	- Dialect groups comprised an aggregate of 3 or 4 section groups speaking the same dialect
	- Ideally, a dialect group includes people of Bangu, Maiawa, and Sangara sections.3
- p.158/179 describes the distances people will or won't likely travel
	- approx 3 dialect groups removed
