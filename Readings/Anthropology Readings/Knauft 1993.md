I got this book out because Christian mentions it in the introduction to [[Dohler 2021 Birds and places]] and I thought it might add some information to [[Ayres 1983]] and [[Williams 1936]] about the anthropological situation of this region. 

The most important thing to find out is whether I need to include reference to this book in my NRI project proposal. I believe this answer to be "no".
## Thoughts

- What is the point of this book? It is called "South Coast New Guinea Cultures" but seems very fixated on homosexuality. Is its purpose to compare cultures using homosexual practice as the comparison point?
	- The opening question: "How can anthropologists describe and compare ethnographic regions?" 
	- The paragraph ends with: "...the autonomy, divisibility, and uniqueness of ethnographic regions cannot be assumed." p.3

- p.4
	- Marxist or politicoeconomic perspectives: identify underlying patterns through integrated analytic assertions.
	- Postmodernist perspectives: stress fragmentation and disorder, both as objects of study and styles of analysis. 
	- At the time of this book's publication (1993) these two perspectives were being combined in anthropological research.


- Anthropologic theory seems to have a tension between cultural influence and individual agency for explaining personal and community behaviour. "...expand the theoretical relationship between culture and practice..." p.5 
- This book appears less to be a description of these cultures, but rather to use the ethnographies published on south coast New Guinea cultures to illustrate the point he is making: that there are considerations that need to be taken when using ethnographies and comparing ethnographies to inform theoretical positions. It appears comparisons were made to other regions of New Guinea without (apparently) adequate appreciation for the different times when the ethnographies were written - the 1910s-30s for the south coast, and 1950s-60s for highland areas. pp. 6-7
- The book is structured into a critique of the more global picture drawn from this comparison (chapters 3-6) and a reconsideration and re-presentation of south coast cultures with an attempt at more objectivity. 
	- The focus on (homo)sexuality appears to be a flaw of the wider research (and broader) communities, and this book appears to attempt to correct that. p.8
