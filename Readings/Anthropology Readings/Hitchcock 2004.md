Thesis primarily focuses on the border between PNG and West Papua, and the anthropology of how this affects the lives of local populations.
Reading this to see if it includes any insights into local populations and lifestyles. In particular, from the table of contents, I'd like to look at:
- Chapter 3
	- Morehead people
	- Dialect and territorial identities
	- Dialect Groups
	- Local section groups
	- Cultural conservatism & cultural inferiority
	- Settlement Patterns
- Chapter 4
	- Land classification
- Chapter 6
	- Borderland Patrols
- Chapter 9
- Appendix 1
	- timeline of historical developments in the Torassi and wider southern New Guinea

### Introduction
- Map p. 12/34 shows Morehead district. 
	- Tonda wildlife management area shown
- p. 11/33 patrol post established at Rouku in 1950, relocated to Morehead in 1959..
- p. 13/35 appears there's a border agreement similar to the Torres Strait treaty with Indonesia; movement permitted for "traditional purposes" such as visiting kin and trading.
- Research questions and aims p. 14/36
	- LOTS of questions
- Each chapter has a "summary" section, likely detailing the conclusion materials for each question
	- Also includes a conclusion chapter

### Chapter 3
