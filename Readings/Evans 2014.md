Positional Verbs in Nen
Evans, Nicholas 2014


### Questions
- Why am I reading this?
One of 3 readings (the others [[Evans 2015 Inflection]] and [[Evans 2015 Valency]]) describing morphosyntax in Nen. A starting point for understanding some morphosyntax in that language, to compare with Namo

- What information do I need from this reading?
What are the main points?
Are there key things to understand about Nen?
Are there any that I recognise that might also apply, or be different, in Namo?

### Cues (my ideas)

Introduction
- I regularly read that "of the 50 morphologically intransitive verbs, 45 are positionals. The others are 'be', its derivatives 'come' and 'go', and 'walk'. THIS IS ONLY 4. What is the other one?

- positional verbs in Nen are identifiable with a -ngr suffix. 
	- In Namo this is -ong or -are.
	- In Nama [[Siegel 2023]], there is no discussion of number therein so unclear whether there is a 4-way distinction or not.
		- Siegel calls the suffixes:
			- Perfective inceptive marker: -ang
			- which then adds a dual marking suffix -(a)r
				- note in Nama the dual copula which is /-re/ in Namo and Nen is split into /-r/ and /-e/, the /-r/ being the dual, and /-e/ being a perfective dual suffix
	- In Nmbo [[Kashima 2020]], -(o)ngr is non-dual, -ara is dual. 
		- Distinguishes 4-way numbers
		- Appendix A.2 on p. 406 contains a list of positionals, including one that is cognate with Namo for 'be placed up high'
	- SO we can say that Namo has lost the -r ending from the non-dual as has Nama. Not ground breaking, but still noteworthy.
