Goals for reading this thesis
- Reading as an example of a grammar submitted as a PhD Thesis
	- Looking at
		- Chapter/section headings, length/detail
		- Elements of a Thesis that might not be in a published grammar
			- Introduction
			- Literature review
			- engagement with the field
		- Data visualisation
		- Experimental design?
	- As a text to be examined, more than a report on knowledge and/or theory

- Is there an "alternative analysis" section/discussion for analyses? Where does this come in?

# Introduction

- detailed description of geography; landscape, vegetation, climate, population, transportation, infrastructure. includes linguistic and social descriptions
	- 4 pages, including maps and figures

- "The Ambel social system is arranged according to exogamous clans: when one marries, one must marry outside of one's own clan". 
	- What does "social system" mean here, and how does it compare/relate to the anthropological descriptions provided by, for example, [[Ayres 1983]] and [[Williams 1936]]? 

- Lots of footnotes. 

- Detailed estimates of speaker numbers based on populations of villages, estimates of age distribution in Raja Ampat as a whole, as well as estimates of Ambel speakers in non-Ambel villages, and non-Ambel speakers in Ambel villages. 

- "Previous studies" includes studies on other languages "on and around the Raja Ampat archipelago". 
	- Includes discussion of the genetic affiliations of Ambel
	- 15 pages 
- Typological and areal perspective section here describes the literature on this topic. The later "overview and typological sketch" provides Arnold's comments and findings on this topic. 
	- Compares Ambel data to other sources on typological characteristics of various linguistic areas
		- Austronesian
		- Austronesian specific to east Nusantara
		- Papuan
		- Papuan specific to the Bird's Head and surrounding islands
		- Proposed but unconfirmed areas, such as Wallacea (p. 27/61). 

- Aims and theoretical framework
	- Basic Linguistic Theory: "attempt to describe each language in its own terms".
	- Describes a lack of theoretical framework, and then lists out sources - grammars, field guides, theoretical discussions - that influenced the analysis.

- Making notes of what people have said then using those for basis of elicitation sessions.
- Elicitation useful for negative data. 
	- ungrammaticality of a certain construction
	- infelicity in certain contexts
	- subtle pragmatic or semantic differences

- "indirective alignment; P and T pattern together but not R"
	- A typology of ditransitive (trivalent) verbs, contrasting Theme with Recipient, and the Patient as more widely discussed. 
	- Indirective contrasts with Secundative, where P and R pattern together. 

- Overview and typological sketch
	- also functions as a summary of the grammar as a whole, organised by chapters
# Notes

- A descriptive grammar doesn't really have a "conclusion" section. Most of the "thesis" elements will likely be included in the introduction.
