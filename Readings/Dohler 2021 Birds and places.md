This paper by Christian looks at multilingualism in the Morehead area and discusses how we can investigate historical multilingualism. I'd like to look at:
- the methodology; quantitative and qualitative of sociolinguistic questionnaires, as well as comparative analysis of bird and plant names.
- the discussion; how conclusions are reached and the strength of support within the data.
Maybe adding Namo information can help with this question?
