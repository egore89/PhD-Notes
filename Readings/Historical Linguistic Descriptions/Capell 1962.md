### Notes (author's ideas)

- The Introduction (page vii) outlines the need for scientific research leading to the production of dictionaries and grammars. 
- Western division starts page 129, with a Map between pp 128 and 129.
- States it's impossible to classify them due to lack of sources, and states a lack of agreed upon nomenclature for languages.
- Notes the disagreement between Ray 1923 and [[20250702_ARCHIVE_Old_Notes/Readings/Anthropology Readings/Williams 1936]] regarding language names. 
	- Capell follows Williams' naming conventions.
- Capell appears to have collected his own data (p. 130) and these agree with and support Williams' classifications. Any discussion of the area of interest relies heavily on Williams' notes and publication.
