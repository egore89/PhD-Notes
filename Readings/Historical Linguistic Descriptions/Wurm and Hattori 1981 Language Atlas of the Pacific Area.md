This is mentioned a few times across a number of readings as the source of language relationships. I believe it has been superseded by Nick's recent writings. It is available in Menzies but as a rare book so ?do I want to loan this out?. It might be worth having a look at to compare with the pdfs I have of Wurm's from the 1970s, and see if it differs in the analysis provided there. 

Fairly low priority.
