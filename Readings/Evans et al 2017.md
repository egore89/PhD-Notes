# Introduction

- p. 7/647: Widespread typological features in Southern New Guinea:
	- complex morphology
		- both prefixes and suffixes for argument indexing
	- complex grammaticalised systems of both aspect and tense
	- complex number values indexed on the verb
		- 3 or more number distinctions
	- distributed morphology and multiple exponence
	- a lack of verb-chaining or switch-reference
		- preference for non-finite constructions in complex sentences
	- lack of tone

- diversity likely due to
	- interaction of unrelated groups entering the area from different regions
	- direct sister-exchange
	- valuing local markers of linguistic allegiance

# Linguistic Sketches

## Yelmek-Maklew
pp. 12/652-15/655
section 6.2.1

- 2 numbers in free pronouns -> singular/non-singular
- 2 numbers in verbal agreement -> dual/non-dual
	- this may be alternate stems, as in Yam languages
- verbal agreement also distinguishes gender
	- similar in Tonda, Yam languages. c.f. [[Dohler 2018]].



## Marindic subgroup
pp. 15/655-23/663
section 6.2.2


- Marindic language distribution suggests movements down the Fly river and the Maro river from Lake Murray, then subsequent movement by Kiwai speakers into the Fly river separating the Marind subgroup from the Tirio and Ipiko (Inland Gulf) subgroups. 
	- Linkage based on gender/number markers in the stem /an_m/ 'person', with the infix 
		  -e- 'male' 
		  -u- 'female'
		  -i- 'plural'
	- preserved in all three groups


## Kolopom and Komolom groups
pp. 23/663-32/672
section 6.2.3

- minimal verbal morphology, notable in southern New Guinea and in Trans New Guinea languages
- Ndom: 3 verb classes, taking different sets of (TAM) markers. Different sets code different person information
- Reduplication used in prohibitive mood


## Marori
pp. 33/673-
section 6.2.4

- TNG, seen in free pronouns
	- consonant encodes person, vowel encodes number
	- considered a salient core property of the TNG family (p.33/673)
- Contrastive stress. Stressed syllable has increased pitch and loudness. Optionally, the vowel can be lengthened.

# Sources
This is a section in Yam languages which covers in great detail the history of linguistic inquiry in SNG, in particular for the Yam languages. Good to check for sources I haven't looked at, and also includes some interesting thoughts, 
- e.g. re. origin of the name Parb.
