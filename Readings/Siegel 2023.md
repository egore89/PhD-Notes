# Chapter 3: Nominal Morphology

### Form vs. function of nominal affixes

Number markers
- Non-singular markers
	- Refer to humans and some culturally important animals
		- -af
			- Most common
			- Occurs after all nominals ending in è, which is deleted
		- -f
			- occurs after certain nominals
			- includes epenthetic è if occurring after a consonant
		- -of
			- not found in naturalistic data
			- paucal number marker
				- 2-3
	- Occur together with most of the major case markers
		- Non-singular marker directly after the stem
		- Separated by the dative case marker
		- Stem + Number + Dative + other case marker/s
- Singular marker
	- Optional, mostly occurs with human referents, God, and significant animals
	- Only occurs preceding another case marker
		- -o

Case markers:
- Ergative
	- Marks the A argument of a transitive verb. Syntactic function.
	- Different forms based on nominal
		- number
		- semantic subclass
		- Form:
			- -am
				- General suffix
				- animate and inanimate nominals
				- stimulus in P-focussed constructions
			- -m
				- used after:
					- personal names
					- plural (and dative) suffix
					- /ár/ "man, person"
					- singular suffix
				- epenthetic schwa where necessary
			- -yam
				- allomorphic variation
					- -am -> -yam / -o___

	- Form:
		- -e
	- Can follow the singular -o suffix
		- Most animate, some inanimate nominals occur like this
	- Word-final è becomes /a/ when followed by the dative suffix
	- Acts as a ligature preceding other case suffix
		- especially for nominals with animate referents
- Instrumental
	- non-animate referents
	- combines with nominals to form adverbs
	- Form:
		- -e
		- homophonous with Dative suffix
- Genitive
	- Possessive
	- Most commonly occurs following the Dative suffix
		- NOT when the stem ends in è, which changes to /a/ when followed by the genitive suffix.

				- following the -o singular marker
	- Can change nominals to adjectives or adverbs
	- Pronoun base
		- 1|2: Absolutive

	- allative function following nominals not ending in /u/ and /au/
	- Form:
		- -ot
		- -yot
			- following
				- nominals ending in /o/
			- follows dative suffix with personal names to form benefactive functions
- Associative

	- follows dative suffix when referring to animate/human referents
	- used instead of allative suffix with human referents
	- Form
		- -faf

	- Pronoun base:
		- Dative
- Semblative
	- "like" or "similar to"
	- Form:
		- -nit
- Attributive
	- indicates that the nominal base is an attribute or characteristic of another nominal
		- thus forms an adjective

	- Can mark the Agentive Subject argument in reflexive sentences
	- Added to temporal nominals to exclude other possible times.

# Chapter 4: Verbal Morphology
Overview:
- Lists out affixes and their usage.
	- Most transitive verbs have corresponding A-aligned intransitive verbs, and may be said to form with the addition of a vowel prefix. Section 12 of this chapter elaborates.

- Section 1: Nominalising suffix
	- /-gh/ suffix can be added to <u>transitive</u> and <u>A-aligned</u> verbs. These then can act as nominals
		- Namo check: Inchoative constructions seen in Nama point to some appearing in the Namo data, such as:
			- "I'm trying to stop" in recording E, (where the nominalised verb also includes another suffix ?case?)
			- "I/you/he/she is about to cut it" and "I'm trying to cook yams on the fire" in recording F.

- Section 2: Core argument affixes
	- <u>Suffixes</u> index <u>A argument of transitive</u> and <u>S argument of A-aligned intransitive</u> verbs. <u>Prefixes</u> index <u>P argument of transitive</u> and <u>S argument of P-aligned intransitive</u> verbs.

- Section 6: Perfectivity
	- <u>Imperfect</u> marks ongoing events: progressive, habitual, iterative aspects.
	- <u>Perfective</u> focuses on the event as a whole OR its boundaries
		- punctual events, and the commencement of non-punctual events
			- includes inceptive and inchoative aspects
	- Perfectivity markers have a form distinction along dual/non-dual lines
		- when <u>either</u> A or P is dual

- Section 7: Imperfect tenses and aspects
	- 3 main tenses:
		- current
		- recent
		- remote
	- 2 aspects:
		- imperfective
		- perfective
	- Thus:
		- Imperfective Current tense:
			- progressive, habitual, or iterative events from today
		- Recent:
			- 2/3 days previous
		- Imperfective remote:
			- progressive, habitual, completed events from long ago. 
			- Divides further into:
				- Remote Delimited
					- distant events completed or lasted a limited time
				- Remote Durative
					- distant events that were continuing or lasted a long time
	- Namo check: Irrealis/realis can be signalled by the presence/absence of the 2|3.sg suffix, with a lack of this suffix signalling irrealis. Does this track in Namo?

- Section 8: Perfective tenses and aspects
	- 3 sections: 
		- Inceptive tenses
		- Remote punctual
		- Remote inceptive

- Section 9: Inceptive Imperfective
	- Involves a combination of imperfective and perfective verbal suffixes
	- Focuses on the inception of an event that does not necessarily have an end

- Section 10: Tense/aspect summary
	- 11 categories marking combinations of 3 aspects and 3 tenses, with some splits inside specific tenses.
