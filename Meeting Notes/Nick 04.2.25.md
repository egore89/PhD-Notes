- Worth checking out the "Cambridge expedition to the Torres Strait" from the early 20th century. 
- TROVE is a place I might find Kiap reports. Chris Ballard also very useful and very approachable.
- Write out some summaries and photocopies into a bound little booklet, and take along at least 3 copies. 2 to hand out, one for myself for notes and stuff.

- Asking about where villages used to be (for example, Tuj in [[Williams' Fieldnotes]] may be Tais (Tz) of today) is a good way to get texts and people talking. People's relationships with these places will also be good texts. 
- People likely return to these places for fishing, activities, and resources.

- Some Nen epenthetic vowels appear to be residuals from full vowels in the proto-language.

- /wa/ -> dual


- The "come" paradigm in the data:
	- /kənaɸ/  likely to be perfective aspect "(begin) to come"
		- this verb has 2 series: perfective, and imperfective

- /-ta/ suffix marks imperfective

- Imperative "go" 
	- /-m/ the non-dual stem
	- /-re/ the dual stem
- like in Nen (see [[Inflection in Nen]] article)
- In the paradigm in the data the prefixes are:
	- /t-/ dual and plural object/undergoer
	- in the singular /kənəŋgəm/ is not /k-ənəŋgəm/ but /kən-əŋgəm/

So these paradigms likely segment as:

| Number   | Verb     | Segmentation                                       |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| singular | kn-ŋg-m  | Singular.MiddlePref.Imperative-Ablative-NonDu.STEM |
| dual     | ta-ŋg-re | non-singular.MidPref.Imp-Abl-Du.STEM               |
| plural   | ta-ŋg-m  | non-singular.MidPref.Imp-Abl-NonDu.STEM            |

- regarding "tell me (it)" /kpwauvro/ the prefix /kpw-/ refers to the 1sg object. the prefix /t-/ to 3sg object in all other verbs in the data.

Nen:
- Imperfective has /-ta/ suffix in the non-dual
- perfective has no/null suffix

Some verbs are only imperfective, only perfective, or may be both imperfective and perfective

- (to) exit likely to be /(a)tor/ -> /k-ŋg-tor/ go out (imp)

- Revisit "hit it" recording to confirm the vowels

- **(to) tie (it)** likely to be /wmbaŋg/ in the infinitive if it's like Nen. 

- In Nen the verb for "to do" and "to tell" are the same.

- An article by Len Talmy from 1985 to do with typology, containing a description of the 3-way distinction described in [[Linguistics Seminar 31.1.25]] for stative/inchoative/causative verbs. Appears to be a chapter in "Language Typology and Syntactic Description" by Shopen.
