# Nen Imperatives
Nick Evans

- 2nd person imperatives are said to be the "base" form in many languages.
	- líka á íslensku?
		-standa -> stattu
		-en það er ending á þessu
	- V+-ðu  -> borða-ðu

	- draga -> dragðu = drag + þú
	- vera -> vertu = ver + þú
	- gefa -> gefðu = gef + þú    er þetta þá /gef-a/?


- Prefixing verbs in Nen also have suffixes, just less obvious and meaningful?

| Nen       | Namo     |
| --------- | -------- |
| kowabta   | kpwauvro |
| speak now | tell me  |
| k-owab-ta | -auv-  ? |

- A speaker in Bimadbn might speak Nen, Yarne, Idi.  -> investigate Yarne further

- Nen *qakapand* "pick this up (for me)" vs. *tkapand* "pick this up"

- Affix categories based on:
	- Subject person number
	- Object person number
	- Aspect
	- Valency
	- Direction

- k-==awa==-kata ==reciprocol== "look at yourself" (same in Namo)
