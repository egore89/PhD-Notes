- Compare place names in Ray and Rentoul etc... with Williams and Ayres, as well as Kiap reports. What do Parb and Dorro etc... actually mean?

- Ray 1923 p. 4 of pdf lists the Torzo tribe on Strachan Island. ? confer with [[PhD_Notes/Readings/Anthropology Readings/Williams' Fieldnotes]]?

- [[PhD_Notes/Readings/Kiap Reports/Kiap Notes/Rouku/Rouk1955]] and other Kiap reports list Iauga population as around 16-17. Were these traditionally Len speakers? 
	- My impression (20/2/25) reading some historical word lists is that Dorro may resemble Namo and Parb resemble Len. Did the regions these languages were spoken in change drastically between the 1920s and 1950s?
