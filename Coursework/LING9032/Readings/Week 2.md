How to write a better thesis
David Evans, Paul Gruba, Justin Zobel

Planning and introducing your study
## Chapter 2

- p.10. Research a combination of:
	- inspiration -> i.e. creative thinking
		- hypothesis generation
		- musing over the odd and surprising
		- finding lines of attack on difficult problems
	- rational thinking
		- design and execution of experiments
		- analysis of results in terms of existing theory

- writing, and research more broadly, involves the tension between our rational and creative brains. 
	- this tension (it is contended) leads to writer's block

- Standard thesis structure
	- Introduction
		- Problem statement
		- Aim & scope
		- Thesis overview
	- Background
		- History, geography
		- Current theory
		- Current practice
	- Core
		- Research design
		- Proposals
		- Results
	- Synthesis
		- Analysis
		- Discussion
		- Conclusions
- p.12 puts analysis in the Core
- A strong Background section can be as useful as the core and "new" work presented later.
	- A new interpretation or synthesis or analysis of previous theories and research

- Seems like the Synthesis part of my thesis is the typological overview of Namo.

- Narrative =/= structure
	- "narrative concerns how you want the reader's thoughts to develop as they read the thesis". p. 14.
	- "structure is how the material is organized to create a narrative".

## Chapter 4
Making a strong start

- write a review showing how the field has been developing and what the current challenges and problems are
	- even a notes summary of this in Yam languages and southern New Guinea/Morehead might be worth spending a day or a week doing.
	- "gathering papers under headings and discussing similar results together in a 'compare and contrast' style". p. 39
		- one of these on Yam languages would be good, 
			- maybe another one, or a smaller one dedicated to the 3 Wurm volumes from the 1970s? 3000+ pages of studies and writings on the New Guinea area.
			- Volume 1 most pertinent to Morehead
				- 2.6.2 Central and Western Trans-New Guinea phylum languages is the part with Morehead languages in it. p. 345
				- Vol 2. Austronesian languages
				- Vol 3. socio-cultural discussions
			- This review definitely needs to discuss Wurm 1975.
		- another on fieldwork and field methods would also be worth doing I think. Thinking about.
			- elicited vs spontaneous data
			- wordlists vs narrative texts
			- semantic fieldwork
			- ?monolingual fieldwork

- sketches of chapters **can** be bullet points

- after the first year should be able to draft:
	- introduction and background chapter(s)
	- research design, setting out the contribution of the thesis
	- reasonable bibliography

- any concrete work early in the phd is time well spent.
- headings in a "working thesis" document can change, and may be unhelpful in the final writeup. 
	- to consider when working with [[20250702_ARCHIVE_Old_Notes/Working Thesis/Working Thesis overview]]

p. 44:
- "To get started on the thesis, you must acknowledge and *harness* \[the tension between rational, conscious thinking and creative, unconscious thinking]."
- To do this:
	- First, devise a logical structure for the whole thesis
		- TOTRY: write introductions to each chapter, then string them together to see whether the report develops logically
			- This would be a good way to develop the Introduction/Background chapter(s). 
- Use writing to drive reading.
	- List papers you haven't read in the place where you expect to discuss them. 
	- Background should mutate from a description of intended reading into an analysis of what you have read.

- Working to constraints is a key element in being an effective researcher
	- Don't get distracted by every path that presents itself in the project, analysis, and results
	- Keep on the main path. (unsure how or whether this applies to me yet)

- Chapters need to have clear purposes just like the thesis as a whole
	- Why is this chapter there? What is its function?
		- An introduction to each chapter is worthwhile. 
- Is the conclusion of my chapters a good place to have my "this is how these forms tie to larger theories" or "past/present/future tenses in Namo" sections? As a little overview of what the deeper analysis has discussed?

- Kiap reports will be classed as "primary sources" cf p 52
	- May be listed as sources rather than included in the bibliography
	- Perhaps in the same way as texts and primary recordings I collect
		- with a reference to the UC San Diego library and other sources I get them from

- Gateways then paths
	- Gateway:
		- a book, paper, or source discovered through active exploring
			- searching online or in librarys
			- also through seminars or colleague recs.
		- find new terminology, and references
	- Paths:
		- citations by and of gateway sources
			- Understanding how other people read and identify relevant and significant sources could help me learn to do that, rather than finding everything important and getting overwhelmed
- Plan your search
	- Identify fields and subfields to explor
		- linguistic analysis
			- SVCs, clause chaining, switch reference
			- 
		- grammar writing
			- structure
			- theory
			- methods

- Supervisors have reliable:
	- Knowledge
	- Instincts
	- Experience


## Chapter 5
The Introductory Chapter

- By this they mean:
	- the short 7-10 pages
		- Context
			- how much context goes here, and how much into background?
		- Problem statement
		- Aim and Scope
		- Significance of the study
		- Overview
	- NOT the 
		- socio-linguistic context
		- background
		- previous work/literature review?

- Take time to write properly, and revise drafts regularly

### Context
- situate the study so readers can understand the specific points of concern
	- In my case:
		- linguistic documentation?
		- grammar writing?
		- southern New Guinea/Yam languages?
	- How much can I assume people understand the process or importance of grammar writing and language documentation? 

### Stating the problem/motivating the study
- My thesis isn't really addressing a problem, so talk about motivating the study
- Not the place for a full literature review

- My questions:
	- How does the grammar of the Namo language work?
		- In what ways is it different from Nama, Nmbo, and Nen?
	- What are the differences between Tais and Mari varieties?

- states the reason the research is worth doing; foreshadows the research aim.
- 4 parts:
	- a <u>brief</u> history of the issue at hand
		- no grammar of Namo has been written
	- A recent increase of the issue
		- interest in Yam languages?
	- dissatisfaction with current knowledge
		- no full published data on Namo, despite existence of retroflex consonants and other interesting features
	- an identification of specific factors
		- phonology, morphosyntax, clause structure


### Aim and scope
- 3 characteristics
	- be a logical consequence of the problem statement
	- singular. one aim
	- the conclusion must respond to the aim
- "To start the process of being critical, you must first set limits." p. 65
	- set the terms of the debate and focus on what is particularly relevant

### Overview of the study
- Annotated table of contents
	- interconnected sentences to ensure logical flow, rather than a list of chapter and section headings
		- a synopsis of the storyline of the thesis
- Describes the method used for the study
	- the authors of the book prefer "overview of the study" to "method" or "research approach"
	- In this case, this section is the "method used to develop the whole of the report or thesis". p. 68


Aim =/= Hypothesis
- Aim:
	- directing something towards an object
- Hypothesis:
	- a proposition made as a starting point for further investigation, based in known facts and observation
