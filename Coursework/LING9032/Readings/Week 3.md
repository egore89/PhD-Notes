Surveying the literature

## Chapter 6
- background section/chapter
	- provide the context
	- be the starting point for an examiner to think about your position
- 4 most common elements:
	- establishment of the context
	- identification of current theory, discoveries, debates
		- evaluation of those most useful and salient to your topic
		- nomination of gaps in these
	- understanding current practices and technologies
	- preliminary investigations
- Not all needed. 
	- For me:
		- establishment of context
		- identification of current theory, understanding, work
			- including related languages

- Writing down my understanding of the research is "a good way to learn how to follow the important arguments through". p. 74
	- -> \*** "But until you have done some work of your own ... it is not possible to be 'critical' in the sense implied by 'a critical review of the literature'."

- Review of current theory serves three purposes (p. 74)
	1.  gives background information required to contextualise the extent and significance of your research problem
		- In the Morehead area this is to do with linguistic typology, genetic affiliations, language families.
	2.  identifies and discusses attempts by others to solve similar problems
	3.  provides examples of methods others have employed in attempts to get these solutions.

- Number 1
	- Ask Who, What, Where, and When.
	- Short, no unnecessary detail.
- You will read much more widely than is needed for the chapter of the thesis.
	- This reading will help you gain an understanding of the "many complex facets" of the problem, but you don't need to write about them in full.
		- -> How does what you are reading relate to achieving the aim and scope of the thesis?

- Deciding what to omit
	- Don't include anything the reader doesn't need in order to understand what follows
	- Don't include anything (in the main text) that interrupts the development of the flow of logic in the argument
	- Include anything that is genuinely clarifying
- Part of my argument is showing that I understand the history of research in the area: why things are classified as they are, how they have been classified in the past,
