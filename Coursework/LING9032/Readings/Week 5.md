### Notes (author's ideas)

- Studies can make many different kinds of contributions, and those contributions need different styles of narratives to explain and convey.
	- deciding on narrative needs to have an understanding of the characteristics of the study.
		- observation vs. innovation
		- case study vs. study
		- theoretical vs. practical
		- principled vs. pragmatic
		- mathematical vs. empirical

- descriptions (observations) first describe the phenomenon, then analyse and evaluate whether the description is valid
	- the description forms part of the hypothesis



### Cues (my ideas)

- experimental studies could also be observational
	- 'what happens when...'
- the opposite here is 'innovation', which I guess involves coming up with new ways to do things based on (others') observations
	- maybe developing a pedagogical grammar, or teaching manual for a language
	- and then involves the evaluation and analysis of the innovated tool(s)
