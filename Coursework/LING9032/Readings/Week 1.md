How to write a better thesis
David Evans, Paul Gruba, Justin Zobel


## Chapter 1

### Notes
 
 - A successful thesis:
	 - Originality of approach and/or interpretation of findings
	 - An examination paper, not just a report of findings
- "...having and demonstrating a critical attitude towards your subject sets the tone of your interactions with the examiners". 
- Prelim. reading a thesis
	- Check layout and table of contents.
		- Does this give me a clear idea of the structure?
	- Introduction, conclusions, and references (?)
	- Introduction carefully. compare with conclusions. 
		- Check how words are spelled
		- Data visualisation
		- Typical chapter length

- [ ] Would like to read this again. Lots to think and chew on.

## Chapter 3
### Notes

- LaTeX -> "markup-based"
- Word processor allows separation of *style* from *content*. 

- [ ] Time to look into offline LaTeX
