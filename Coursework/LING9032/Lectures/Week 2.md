## Notes

Planning and Introducing your study

- Context
	- What context is your project taking place in?
		- situational / application
		- historical
		- geographical or geopolitical
		- theoretical framework or contribution
-> These lead to your disciplinary perspective
		- where are you coming from?
		- which are you aligned with
			- \** "framework free grammar"

- What makes the study:
	- important
	- interesting
	- timely

- what does it add to our understanding of the field
	- -> \** can I add to our understanding of
		- documentation?
		- analysis?
		- fieldwork?
		- grammar writing / grammatology?
		- typology
		- historical linguistics

- conclusions speak to and refer back to <u>aim</u> and objective
	- have you done what you said you would do?
- aim relates closely to thesis title

- writing about the scope of a study/thesis helps manage readers' expectations

- research questions/hypotheses:
	- question to address -> what is \[x]
	- hypothesis to <u>test</u> -> I think \[this] is why \[x].

- research question can emerge from critical evaluation of existing research
	- we <u>can</u> highlight limitations of a study without dismissing the study, its results, and its conclusions

\** is there space in my thesis for a more sociolinguistic or even anthropological description of more social texts/documentation?
- -> ?a final chapter going over what cultural practices have been captured in the documentation.

- take reader from aim to conclusion, via arguments and evidence
	- -> **clearly**

- Thesis introduction:
	- -> 5-10 pages for phd is standard, but is likely going to be more for me because of all the background - sociolinguistic, historical, anthropological?, etc... - that I will include
	- is written with a more general readership in mind
		- basically the introduction to my introduction chapter
			- is there space for a very short introduction, and then a background and previous research chapter? Or would that complicate things too much?

- Questions to ask while reading thesis introductions:
	- what are the main points?
		- how do I know what these are?
		- how easy is it to identify these?
	- can I see what is known? the background
	- can I see what is being added by this thesis?

- Something to look into TODO
	- spontaneous vs elicited data 
		- how to gather spontaneous data?
			- add a section to [[Elicitation notes]]

- people reading my thesis might not be familiar with the socio linguistic context of the project
	- this is why there is such a large section about this.
