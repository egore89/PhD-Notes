## Notes

- Community of scholars -> authorities in the field
	- grammar writing
	- Yam languages
	- structural linguistics
		- syntax & morphology
		- phonetics & phonology
		- clause structure
	- fieldwork
		- elicitation
		- recording
	- language documentation and description
- Thesis: incorporates an account of research done for the project
- sending drafts to supervisor
		-> drafts *not* perfect
- Github for backups & version control
	- latex/word files
	- new files with dates in names for updates
		- can delete old versions after a while
- Read [[Evans et al 2017]] for a good intro overview of the area
- Other background readings
	- grammatology
	- fieldwork
	- documentation and description
	- corpus design and development

- Field shading 
	- highlights things Word does automatically, e.g. citations, section numbers
		- File -> options -> advanced -> show document content
		  -> dropdown by field shading: never, always, when selected
- Paragraph -> spacing -> before/after add space before or after the paragraph
						-> this is better than adding extra line breaks
- Insert -> Quick Parts (under the Text heading) -> Field
	-> Category: Numbering
		Field Name: Seq (sequential)
		Field Code (add something here; examples, extracts, etc.... This will group those kinds of number lists together)
- There is a process of something like "insert document parts" that can collate multiple word files together.
- Serif font is good for theses
	- Latex default is serif
	- ? how to change fonts in Latex?
		- for cross linguistic examples? Do Kashima/Arnold/etc... do this?
- Review phd theses that have been grammars.


## Thoughts

Start thinking about which 10 references to include in Assessment 1. 
- ? All Yam languages?
- Surely some documentation/description/grammatology/fieldwork references?
- ? anthropology references?
