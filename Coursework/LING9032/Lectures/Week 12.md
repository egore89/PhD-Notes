# Week 12

- Structure makes the piece easier to read.
	- Do we want the reader to spend their energy and time processing the sentences? Or on the content and analysis?

- dot points are fine, but writing in sentences and paragraphs requires linking ideas, bringing everything together. 

- examiners are experts in the field, not your thoughts and arguments. We have to explain how to join the dots. 
	- part of this is helping them understand the analysis and findings
	- another part is showing them that we understand the field, background, etc...

- make sure the reader knows why they need to know what you're telling them

- visuals can help structure and plan
	- maybe a powerpoint with slides for sections or even paragraphs

- subheadings don't have to be numbered; after the third number (1.1.1), smaller sections may not need to be numbered (note latex does this as a default, having a limit to the numbers)

- where the analysis requires non-linear understanding (points require understanding of each other to be understood), but needs to be presented in a linear manner, it's ok to state this outright in the introduction to the discussion. 
	- transparency to the decisions made for how things are structured

- writing needs to be authoritative; confident, demonstrative
	- don't make claims that aren't substantiated in the thesis
- plain language, but using relavent terminology
