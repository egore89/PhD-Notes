Lecture

Background Chapter

Literature Review Goals:
- Nature of the field relative to inquiry
- identify debates and define terms
	- is Evans vs. Siegel re analysis of verbal morphology in Yam languages a debate?
		- A debate more likely to need addressing is the top-down "theory mapped to forms" vs. bottom-up "forms mapped to meanings" approach to description.
- underpinned by a point of view or argument that makes this cohesive
	- -> there are gaps in the literature, these are important to address
	- \* -> why is it important to include Namo in our understanding of Yam languages, southern New Guinea languages, distributed exponence, etc...
- What descriptive grammars & PHDs does [[Arnold 2018]] refer to? Worth getting
	- This will give me different conventions and requirements for other universities outside ANU

- Scope of the background readings:
	- Too narrow:
		- surveying the literature only on a particular language or language family
- How does my topic fit into other sub-disciplines of linguistics?
	- typology
	- syntactic theory
	- language change
	- language learning
	- linguistic diversity
		- why this happens and why SNG is so diverse?
	- grammar writing
- Write defensively
	- anticipating the kinds of questions and confusions a reader might have

Current Theories: Foundation
- concise accounts of key work
	- Wurm, Ross, etc.. are key to understanding TNG and Papuan affiliations
		- Yam languages exist within these banners
- Are there theory based grammars?
	- aligned with a theoretical framework as opposed to Carroll and Arnold which aren't
- Two kinds of debates:
	- regarding the meanings of definitions, terms, or methodologies
	- regarding interpretations of results of different studies on the same topic

Reading Critically
- First reading looks at what they're saying
	- -> later readings might think more about
		- study design
		- do conclusions follow from results?
		- other limitations

- The journal "Lingua" used to be reputable for linguistics, but now is now, since around 2013
	- "Glossa" has replaced it
	- Older Lingua papers are still reputable

- Ross has a bunch of publications on relating languages based on pronouns. Worth looking at his earliest work on this. Might make the process more clear. TODO

- Older (+/- outdated) studies still made contributions, especially to the field at the time of their publications
	- Research is incremental

Literature Review Structure
- 8-15000  is standard 
	- BUT don't go by a word or page count, rather be thinking "have I covered everything that needs to be covered?"
- Addressing the literature in a chronological way may make linking ideas difficult
	- grouping ideas by themes - issues and concepts - is more typical
		- The first is probably good for my "history of linguistic work in SNG"
		- the second is good for "theories of grammar writing/linguistic analysis"
- Sources that fit multiple sections of the literature review may be referenced multiple times; in each section for which it is relevant
	- these can also make good segues or links between different sections/topics

- TODO Prominence, stress, prosody
	- an area of Phonetics receiving interest

- For descriptions of things there is theory and debate
	- how do I engage with these for all things I will describe?
		- how do other phds do that?
- how are cases defined
	- what does dative/genitive/instrumental mean?

- \** this returns to the form vs function discussion
	- \*** this is what goes in a background/literature review chapter
- e.g. -> what do I observe as the correlation of prominence/stress in Namo.

Reading advice:
- in Rosey's example article from the lecture the first sentences of each paragraph tells the reader what the paragraph says
	- this is a good way to write as well
- some papers may not be as good at this

Literature search
- Google Scholar + ANU library access permission
- set up mailing lists to send alerts with new research
