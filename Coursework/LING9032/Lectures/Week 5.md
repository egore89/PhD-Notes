Lecture

Methods

- Topic, background, "setting the scene" all lead up to the methods

- Your methods say something about you as the student researcher

- Different disciplines ask different questions, use different tools, thing about the relationships differently
	- different accepted ways of finding out stuff, called 'warrants'

- I guess the methods most pertinent to writing a grammar is the linguistic analysis
	- how are the different structures presented, described, and analysed
		- how much theoretical background is given
		- which theoretical frameworks are used, even if not explicitly stated
		- form to function, or function to form?

- Methodology
	- the sum of all the pieces of methods used in the project
	- research approach taken to investigate and build knowledge
		- how will I find out?
		- how can/could I find out?

- Paradigms and methods
	- (maybe insert the slide from the lecture here?)

- People believe what we've written about our experiments or discoveries because of the validity, rigour, and how we've talked about our methods

- Some of the trustworthiness/validity of the methods comes up to how much detail is provided
	- are outliers, alternatives, messiness acknowledged?
	- have you conveyed what you've done in enough detail
		- could someone reprodouce the research if they want to?

- What literature exists on linguistic analysis from a methods and a "how to" kind of frame?
	- Oxford handbook to start?
		- When we say "linguistic analysis" what do we really mean? A lot of articles seem to focus on the process of fitting language data to a framework, but what I mean is 'understanding what each construction is doing and deciding how to describe that'. What is that called in the literature?
