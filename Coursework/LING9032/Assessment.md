# Assessment 2

- This is going to be a draft of the Introduction section as laid out in the reading, chapter 2.
	- i.e. "problem statement, aim and scope, steps taken to achieve the aim" p. 40. 
	- not the full introduction as in other descriptive grammars.
- dot point notes for chapters of thesis

### Content for Introduction
- Basic "setting and speakers" information
- "the problem", i.e. "what is the grammar of Namo?"
- Aims and theoretical framework

- in 2000 words I should be able to write the beginning parts. 
	- This thesis describes the major aspects of the grammar of Namo...
		- Establishing the context
	- Namo is a language spoken in Papua New Guinea
		- a brief overview of the previous research on the language and language family
		- Motivations for studying Namo - stating the problem/motivation
			- No previous work on Namo
			- Desire from local community
			- Low speaker numbers
			- More languages provides a richer picture of possibilities of human linguistic competence
		- Significance of Namo in particular:
			- retroflex consonants, something weird in the dual, distributed exponence -> significant for theories of development of Yam languages
			- no previous studies based out of Tais
	- A brief overview of previous studies on Namo and Yam languages more broadly
		- 
	- In describing this language I aim to do...
		- theoretical framework
	- Scope
		- Including an outline of the sections of the thesis. 
		- Takes a bottom-up approach to structure, following [[20250702_ARCHIVE_Old_Notes/Readings/Grammar Writing/Catching Language/Mosel 2006]] section 6.2
	- Overview of the thesis structure
		- different from the typological overview section of the background chapter, which goes into specifics
		- -> this section is saying "chapter 2 does this, chapter 3 does this including this and this..." \[**DONE**]

- I'm not actually sure whether I need dot-points for all chapters, but in case I do I have some ideas here
	- Preliminaries
	- This chapter covers:
		- The cultural setting and lifestyles of the speakers of Namo and other Yam languages
		- The sociolinguistic setting
			- Speaker numbers and language vitality
		- Previous research on Yam languages and communities
		- A typological overview of the Namo language
		- This section gives brief outlines of the structures analysed throughout the thesis, and compares Namo to other typologies of other Papuan language families.
	- Phonology
	- This chapter covers:
		- Segmental phonetics and phonology
			- Consonants
				- Includes discussion of allophonic variation
			- Vowels
				- Includes a section on vowel epenthesis which is a regular phenomenon in other Yam languages
		- Suprasegmental phonology
			- Intonation and stress
			- Syllable structure
			- Morphophonemic processes
				- Covers any regular morphophonemic changes that occur
# Assessment 3

- On classifying/counting languages 
	- Kashima 2020 describes the Nambu branch as a dialect chain, and then provides justification for calling each language a language.
	- Ayres 1983 describes two languages: Tonda and Nambu.
		- What does she say about the dialect variations? Not a linguistics text, after all.
	- Williams 1936 uses data from 7 different languages. 
	- Ray 1923 describes 3 languages in the Bangu group, 7 languages in the Sanana group, and 3 languages in the Parb group. Bangu is Tonda, and the other two (Dungerwab and Parb) are Nambu. No mention of Dorro.
	- Riley and Ray 1930 lists 3 languages. Peremka, related to Bangu; Dorro, and Parb. These are noted as samples from larger language groups.


This assignment is to write out a part of a chapter, and I'd like to cover the history and literature published on the Yam family/southern New Guinea/Trans-Fly region. My inspiration is [[20250702_ARCHIVE_Old_Notes/Readings/PhDs/Arnold 2018]] and her coverage of previous research on Ambel and the other Raja Ampat languages. 
Structure:
- Introduction
	- -> Short, give a quick overview of what is to come?
		- Might need to outline the purpose and parameters of this, re. the scope, and also acknowledging that the knowledge contained herein is not all the knowledge ever had on the area. 
	- Am I going to have three sections for the three major phases of study on this area? I think I might like that, and this assignment could be a good place to test it out and get some feedback.
	- -> If so, the introduction might be the place to set this scene
- Phase 1: Contact and initial wordlists
	- Describe in chronological order the wordlists published
- Phase 2: Classification and making families
	- Again, chronological order
- Phase 3: Descriptive studies
	- Of which the present thesis is a part.

- Where do I discuss how we define "language" in this region? In each phase individually? As a conclusion or summary paragraph?
- How do I frame this? As European research in the area? I can say something about the "dialect nicknames" in [[20250702_ARCHIVE_Old_Notes/Readings/Anthropology Readings/Williams 1936]] with reference to [[20250702_ARCHIVE_Old_Notes/Readings/Anthropology Readings/Ayres 1983]] about how the people who speak these languages have long had an understanding of language, connected to place. In the introduction.

- This section serves primarily as the 'locate a study in time, location, or culture' part of the background work. Secondarily it covers identification of current theory, including the development of that. 
	- Do I need to consider or cover the question of how has linguistic inquiry changed since the 1890s? What were the goals of linguistics as a field then? And the context in which Ray and them were working? Or is it enough to simply mention them, now that we are so far removed from that time? 
	- Broadly the goals are fairly simple to articulate
		- Ray et al: record and identify languages spoken
			- record wordlists and basic phrases
		- Wurm et al: identify how the languages are related to one another
			- Using lexicostatistics and short 200-word wordlists.
			- Results published in [[Voorhoeve 1968]] are based on the wordlists published in 1930-1 by [[Riley & Ray 1930]]. No new data.
			- 
		- Evans et al: understand how such diversity came to be
			- using detailed grammatical descriptions
