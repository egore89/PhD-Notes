### Notes

noken pasim maus hat tumas
don't     ???   mouth hard too.much 
"don't make the sounds too hard"

- chol (pronounced /kol/) is a short way of saying "tasol". Homophonous with "kol" above

- koki nogat cockatoo tasol. em i olgeta australian birds

- long = bilong
	- apparently, in usage
	- em i go long haus bilong kisim kaikai 
	  "he/she/it is going to the house to get food"
- orait has more than just "alright" connotations. it's more "good"; a person or thing is "orait"

- en -> bilong en 
	- same as "em"

wai nau yu stap long hap
why now you stop PREP there
why are you there?

- inap 
	- can also request permission
		inap mi kisim poto long yu?
		inap mi traim kaikai bilong yu?
- can also challenge/deride someone
		yu no inap "you're not enough"
			-> can also add more information after "inap", about what they're not 'inap' to do

-  \* apparently "yumipela" is not really a native word, only used by expats? \*

### Notes

- hap can also mean "half" but only when combined with the word, NOT followed by a preposition
	- haptok "half talk"
	- hapkek "half cake"
		- -> hap long kek "place of the cake"
- kamapim is kind of informal, but apparently fine
	- unclear when appropriate
		- nefyu bilong me kamapim gutpela soka pleya
			- ?
- dispela manmeri i wok long PNG
	- /i/ predicate marker -> acts as relativiser?
		- Check grammar
- "start to (verb)" only the second verb takes the transitive -im
- ol lain long hap "people from there"
- mi/yu yet
	- really just talking about me/you
- can add olgeta to mi/yupela to emphasise everyone
- question markers:
	- a 
		- expects the answer to be yes
		- bihain mi bungim yu long taun a?
	- o
		- unsure whether answer will be yes or no
- kaikai doesn't take -im when used as a verb "to eat", even with an object
	- apparently can say kaikaim pk
	- snek i kaikaim mi
	  a snake bit me (is biting me?)
