## Notes

dispela piksa em i gat eitpela dok
this picture has 8 dogs/there are 8 dogs in this picture
This is they kind of syntax for saying "there are \[number] \[things] in this..."

Ordinal numbers add namba- to the number word
"first" isn't often a concept
nambawan also for "best"

pikinini em i gat sevenpela krismas
the child is 7 yrs old
note the use of 'em' with the noun

The concept of 'nothing' is expressed using:
'no gat wanpela samting'
'there is not one'
- i no gat wanpela samting long hap
there is nothing over there

ol i gat samting olsem tetifaif(pela) kotkot
they have about 35 crows

(long) asde em i bin baim sikis bek rais
She/he bought 6 bags of rice
When 'long asde' comes at the start, the 'bin' becomes more required.
'long asde' can come at the end of the sentence, and then 'bin' may be less required.
'long' may be omitted in informal/casual speech

skul em i nidim samting olsem 21 tisa
the school needs approx. 21 teachers

em i no gat wanpela samting long bai
there is nothing left to buy

Praim Minister i no gat wanpela samting long tok
The Prime Minister has nothing to say

dispela ron bai i kisim olsem samting tripela hauwa na faivpela minute
This trip will take about 3hrs 5minutes
nambaut can also replace samting olsem
note 'kisim' here for 'take', or 'require'. note also that this makes it a future tense
note 'bai' preceeds 'i', but 'bin' will follow
dispela ron i bin go inap long tripela hauwa
this trip took us 3 hours. 
'go inap' kind of means 'go until'

Ol i no gat wanpela samting bilong en/ol
They don't own anything?
