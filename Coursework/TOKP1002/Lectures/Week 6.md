## Notes

- kirimapim bel bilong yu
	- passion about
	- wanem samting kirimapim bel bilong yu

- yu tupela \[person] 
	- You two \[you and person]
- e.g. yu tupela man bilong yu i stap olsem wanem?
	- -> what's life like for you and your husband?

- 'stap' on its own is only temporary. 'save stap' is more permanent, as in living.
	- the same applies to 'mekim'; 'yu mekim wanem' is 'what are you doing right now', whereas 'yu save mekim wanem' is more 'what do you do'
