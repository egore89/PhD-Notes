# Latex notes

- gb4e Latex package useful for linguistic examples, includes capacity for ungrammatical and judgement calls about sentences. 
- 2.5cm margins
	- \\usepackage\[margin=2.5cm]\{geometry}
- [[Arnold 2018]] has a large tables (e.g. PDF 214) that are presented landscape on the page, and the PDF reader automatically turns them right-side up. How do we do this?

- packages
	- gb4e instead of linguex
	- (as in MA thesis)

- decisions to make (probably much later in the phd)
	- page prettiness
		- lines as in Arnold, Carroll, Billington?
			- these are not seen in any other anu theses
			- I think I like it better with than without, if the page header is going to include chapter and section information
		- chapter headings as in Kashima?
		- reference list
- Page numbers
	- I hate when the page number of the PDF doesn't match the page number in the document. BUT some PDFs include frontmatter numbering (e.g. small roman numerals) in that PDF page number.
		- Is this done in Latex? 
			- If so, how?
- In the PHD version of Dohler's thesis in the acknowledgements he mentions a Latex package that helped with interlinear glossing

# Notes

Possible other chapters:
- TAM
- Valency
- Information Structure
- Discourse phenomena
- Non-declarative speech acts
- Final chapter situating Namo into a broader typological field, and perhaps summarising any difficult analyses? or places for future analysis?

- Where do other theses have their "alternate analyses" and "theoretical discussion" of specific linguistic realms? 
	- Do the phonology sections discuss issues of phonological analysis? And the syntax sections discuss issues of syntactic analysis?
	- Where are considerations of alternative analyses presented?
- These two could end up in a final chapter including:
	- typological overview/assessment
		- or maybe focusing on implications
	- alternative analyses
	- questions left unanswered

- Worth holding space for starting to write in all chapters below
	- overview
	- bullet forms
	- maybe include readings specific to each topic? 
	- theoretical concepts I'll want/need to explain
		- prosody, stress, intonation in Phonology
		- circumfixes vs. pre/suffixes in morphosyntax/verbal morphology?
		- 

- Theoretical issues and discussions about each individual topic can go in a preliminary section in each chapter and even each section
	- for example, a discussion of acoustic properties and analysis of stress and prosody can start this section of the phonology chapter.

- If I'm going to describe this language entirely on its own terms, should I eschew terms such as "nominals" and "verbals" entirely? Then I could start sections with names that refer directly to the forms being observed and described? 
	- This could lead nicely to a chapter bringing it all back around to a comparative/typologically broader chapter 
		- Possibly taking [[Haspelmath 2010]] and [[Haspelmath 2009]] a little too literally.
			- Is there a reference talking about how to do this without being too literal about it?
	- I believe there is something to [[Dixon 1997]] and [[Newmeyer 2007]] in here as well, that we need certain structural, formal, and theoretical terms and frames in order to do this work well. 
	- -> The answer lies in the middle, where we take the language as it comes but use previous works and terms to guide our investigation (particularly such a time-limited one as a phd)
		- I think [[Arnold 2018]] does this in the way I want to, first listing out the theoretical works for guidance and then going over the actual descriptions that guide this as well. For me that's other works on Yam languages, as well as other descriptive grammars which might have interesting ideas. 
			- [[Arnold 2018]] has lists of references for particular theoretical and practical topics.
# Introduction/Background

## Notes

- Sources for geographic, population, background on the region in Morehead/Tais: 
	- [[Hitchcock 2010]] and [[Hitchcock 2004]]
	- [[Evans et al 2017]] and related articles
	- [[Siegel 2023]]
	- [[Kashima 2020]]
	- Local PNG reports, such as [[Tapari 1988]]

- Would it be appropriate to list a few individuals and the languages they speak, in order to give an idea of how multi-lingual people are? 
	- perhaps also to describe some of their movement; how often do they go to other villages, garden places, that sort of thing. 

- How overview of the region can I get? Can I describe major centres? Movement of people? Approximate travel times? Frequency of travel to other places, and visitors coming to Tais?

- This might be a good place to describe difficulties in mapping the area, why it's hard, what efforts have been done, etc...
	- Every source seems to have different maps
		- Hitchcock, Yam language sources, Pahoturi language sources, Google Maps
		- Historical sources

- The question is, how much does this contribute to the objects of the thesis? Is this relevant background? 
	- One of the questions I might be addressing is something along the lines of: "now we have a reasonable understanding of the languages of the area (particularly Nambu branch). What picture is emerging of the distribution of these languages, their vitality, speaker numbers, usage, etc..."

- It would probably be good to include at least one reference to an official census in PNG, and then to mention the unreliability of such numbers.
	- I think there's a copy of 2011 at the National Library

- Are there villages with closer ties to Tais? especially regarding sister-exchange? Or are Tais-born women spread throughout the area? Where are the people who move to Tais most likely to come from?

- "Previous studies" to include all sources available, including historical texts. 
	- See [[History of linguistic study in the Morehead area]]
	-

Possible Sections:
- Short introduction to the thesis and project with an ?outline? of the chapter at large.
- Setting and speakers
	- Geography
	- Populations
	- Social structure/culture
		- exogamous sister-exchange
	- Historical setting
- Sociolinguistic overview
	- Vitality
	- Multilingualism
- Previous studies (Lit review)/Background/theoretical considerations
	- Theories of grammar writing and linguistic analysis
	- 3 (what's another word for "era") of study
		- Colonial 1890-1974
		- Wurm/Voorhoeve/Ross 1960s-early 2000s
		- Evans et al 2009-present
			- Discussion of the changing of the genetic categories provided in [[Evans et al 2017]] and other works due here. 
	- Genetic affiliation
- This Project
	- Fieldwork
	- Methodologies
		- This section might be worth placing higher, even first within this chapter. This is where the "Introduction" comes in as per the readings in [[Coursework/LING9032/Readings/Week 2|Week 2]]
	- Outline of the thesis (may also be a standalone section at the end of the chapter)
- Typological overview
	- c.f. [[Siegel 2023]] as well as other PhDs for how to structure my own impressions
	- ?maybe this is worth putting in a chapter at the end of the thesis for "conclusions"?
		- [[Arnold 2018]] uses this section as an overview of the thesis as a whole
