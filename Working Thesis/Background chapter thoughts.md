- Annual report on British New Guinea 1888-89 AND 1889-90 is available online through the ANU library
	- in which the Morehead river is discovered by Europeans for the first time
	- ==some wordlists are available==
- Searching 'british new guinea report' yields a number of these reports from the late 19th century

- Zero Patient prefix used with A-aligned Intransitive verbs in [[20250702_ARCHIVE_Old_Notes/Readings/Siegel 2023]] is equivalent to Middle prefix/verbs in [[20250702_ARCHIVE_Old_Notes/Readings/Evans 2014]]. Siegel's P-aligned Intransitive verbs are Evans' Prefixing, highly restricted verb class.

- Debate regarding framework-free description as outlined in [[20250702_ARCHIVE_Old_Notes/Readings/Grammar Writing/Theoretical frameworks/Haspelmath 2009]] could be worth describing and aligning with one side in a background chapter
	- this kind of summary is not something I've seen in other descriptive grammars
	- if I am introducing new terms for different grammatical structures then it might be worth having a section of these in the introduction.
- Is there space for me to have a "typological comparison" or "comparative concepts" chapter at the end? Using Basic Linguistic Theory, or another framework? An attempt to bridge descriptive and comparative linguistics/typology?
	- Including other Yam languages?

- Framework for my description
	- Prioritises an approach that does not apply categories to Namo, tries to describe the language on its own terms.
- At the end of the day, I want to describe Namo without trying to force it to fit certain frameworks, but I also need to use concepts such as affix, verb, word order formal characteristics, morphosyntactic processes. 
	- I would like to include more than just one sentence in my "theoretical framework" section
		- State/summarize the goals of [[20250702_ARCHIVE_Old_Notes/Readings/Grammar Writing/Theoretical frameworks/Haspelmath 2009]] as "describing the language on its own terms"
		- Acknowledge from [[20250702_ARCHIVE_Old_Notes/Readings/Grammar Writing/Theoretical frameworks/Newmeyer 2007]] that certain categories are extremely useful, and that formal criteria are widely used and useful for describing and understanding certain phenomena
		- Where does Basic Linguistic Theory fit? Do I list it as the foundation? Or describe more as the foundation?
		- Referring to other published work on Yam languages as a guide for what formal characteristics to expect
			- Could I have a chapter on unexpected finds? A section? Something to show that I thought about and held space for things not described in other languages?
			- Then I can have an overview of the different descriptions such as case, and verbal morphology. 
				- Need to investigate how Tonda languages are different/the same as Nambu languages in order to include those analyses here also
