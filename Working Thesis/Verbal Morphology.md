- 20130920-E annotation number 015
	- contains interesting discussion of /kəʃjennəm/ '(3sg) is coming' 
		- 'jennə or jennəm'

- in the "come/go" paradigms there's elements of the ?causative? aspect, similar to positional verbs where they have different ?aspects? = be up high, cause to be up high, inchoative (begin to be up high)
	- -> which morpheme carries this information? I think it's the imperative in Nen, isn't it? The prefix?

- imperative prefix /kən-/ in 'go' paradigm also present in 'come' imperatives
	- interestingly, it appears in all numbers, where number appears to be shown by suffixes
	- note too that this is the paradigm that differs so significantly from the infinitival 'is coming' series
		- -> which also appears with the /kəsh/ word that I don't know what to do with [[Lexicon]]
	- -> does the infinitival '(noun) is going' paradigm change?
		- 'x ksh engm' for 'x is going' (plural)?
			- 'jnd darut wngm' is 'i am going to Daru'

|     | come (imp) | come (inf) | go (imp) |

| sg  | kənaɸ      | jenm       | knngm    |

- the nominaliser/infinitival suffix /-ð/ followed by the ?purposive?allative? suffix /-(ə/o)t/
	- seen in 20130920-E annotation 25 'i'm trying to stop' and 
	- -> compared to the purely nominal purposive suffix seen in 20130921-F 'I'm going for (the purpose of) water' where it is clearly /-ot/ 
		- -> are these the same suffix? c.f. [[Siegel 2023]] where I believe they are
			- also check [[Kashima 2020]] and [[Positional verbs in Nen]] for Nmbo and Nen data

- 20130920-E annotations 46-7 show different time depths to 'past' tense
	- 'nujang' up to yesterday
		- ambom kai nujang 'the child fell down yesterday'
		- ambom ktand jeshan nujai 'the child fell down last year'

- 20130920-F annotations 6-8 re 'cut'
	- -> in annotation 7, M3 seems to give /tənβaŋg/ as the present tense "i am cutting it". Following annotations are for past tense, with much discussion. 


- positional verb 'be up high' has two prefixes: /j-/ and /e-/. Likely in the alpha category. 
	- Current tense. see paradigms for 'sleep'
