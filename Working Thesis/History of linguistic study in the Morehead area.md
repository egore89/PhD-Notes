This note is to hold all my thoughts about the section of my Introduction chapter where I go over all the work done on the languages and cultures of this area. 
Connects to:
- anthropology readings
- historical linguistic descriptions
- kiap reports?

## My understanding of the history of linguistic study in the Morehead area

- 1890 Morehead river discovered
	- source [[Hitchcock 2004]] Appendix 1 
		- Do I need to obtain the official report from 1889-90 referenced by this source? DONE
- Annual report on British New Guinea 1895 contains wordlists from Morehead region, uses name "Bangu"
- 1907 Reports on Cambridge Expedition to the Torres Strait
	- Ray includes wordlists from Morehead area
	- -> these wordlists the same as produced in the report in 1895-6
- 1914 A.P. Lyons published wordlists in the Annual Report on British New Guinea. 
	- pp. 193-5.
- 1923 Ray publishes languages of Western Division of Papua
	- Article in the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute
- 1926 Rentoul publishes Vocabulary at Daru Station
	- no wordlists from Morehead area
	- Annual report to parliament on the Territory of Papua
- 1926-32 Williams visits region
	- 1936 [[Williams 1936]] published
- 1930 Riley and Ray publish Sixteen Vocabularies
	- Seem to be articles in a journal called Anthropos
		- The International Journal of Anthropology and Linguistics. Still current.

- 1940s Kiap reports from Morehead
	- [[More1943]]
	- [[More1946]]
	- [[More1950]]
- 1950 Police station at Rouku established
	- Kiap reports for 1950s
- 1959 Police station moved to Morehead

- 1968 Voorhoeve publishes Report on language situation in southern New Guinea
	- [[Voorhoeve 1968]]
- 1971 Wurm visits area
	- [[Wurm 1971]]
- 1975-77 Wurm edits and publishes large volume on Papuan languages
	- [[Wurm 1975]]
- This involved the positing of the Trans-New Guinea hypothesis of related languages.
	- Included Morehead-Upper Maro (Yam) languages as TNG

- 2005 Pawley publishes Papuan pasts
	- [[Ross 2005]] reviews findings and genealogical groupings in [[Wurm 1975]]
	- Based on pronoun forms
- Revises and refines the TNG hypothesis
	- Removes Morehead-Upper Maro 'phylum' from TNG, but retains the same group re. members as Wurm.

- 2009 Evans publishes [[Evans 2009]]
	- Summarises and revisits "Morehead Upper-Maro" classification
- Hammarstrom 2009 names Namo on a map. 
	- States that it's not clear whether Tonda Nambu and Yei are related, but based on numerals seems likely (p. 306/2). 
	- Goes over just the counting systems and includes fair analysis of Nambu, Tonda, and Yei. 
- 2012 [[Evans 2012]] continues and solidifies
- 2017 [[Evans et al 2017]] 

## Notes

- "Previous studies" Introduction chapter, to include all sources available, including historical texts.
	- A discussion of Dorro and Parb here.
		- Do I need to explain why the language is called Dorro in glottolog and ethnologue? Probably. One TODO for during and after a bit of fieldwork is to understand the difference between Mari and Tais varieties, and the social and population situations of these villages.
			- Mari is much more established
			- What language do Tais speakers really speak? How much Len is there? My impression is that Len is close to Parb, based on the wordlist in Ray and Riley. 
				- Stated outright in [[Wurm 1971]]
- How should I set this out? Separate sections for each source? Each wordlist source? Or one big section comparing all the wordlists? 
	- How much do the wordlists differ? A good place to start. TODO
	- Need to work out how to reference kiap reports. [[Reading TODOs]] has some notes on this.
- A difficulty in understanding the history of languages is that the naming conventions in older sources follow village names? 
	- Using the word for "what" is old AF in local mythology. cf [[Ayres 1983]]
	- How have village names changed in the last 100 years? Why are there so many words in Riley & Ray, or Williams that don't correspond to modern villages? 

- How much of the debate around TNG do I need to include in my thesis? 
	- Probably a fair bit, don't I?
		- Wurm puts Morehead-Upper Maro languages in TNG
			- Based on what?
		- Ross pulls it out
			- Based on what?
		- Currently not considered part of TNG
- -> When were Austronesian languages identified? When were Papuan languages identified, and on what bases?

## Sections in Introduction/Background chapter

- A section to start that covers the "Introduction" section discussed in "How to write a better thesis" [[Coursework/LING9032/Readings/Week 2|Week 2]]
	- Problem statement
	- Aim & Scope
	- Thesis overview
		- Includes an overview of the rest of the Introduction chapter (or background chapter, depending on which I want to include)
- Previous studies (Lit review)
	- This section covers the Background section
		- History, geography
		- Current theory
		- Current practice
	- 3 (what's another word for "era") of study
		- Colonial 1890-1974
			- Where do kiap reports fit in this? 
			- [[Williams 1936]] 
			- [[Ray 1923]] 
			- [[Riley & Ray 1930]] 
			- These ones have wordlists. 
		- Wurm/Voorhoeve/Ross 1960s-early 2000s
			- Wurm 1975 has a number of chapters on classification of Papuan languages that would be worth looking over. Chapters 1.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
			- Worth keeping in mind that these studies are not great
				- No mention of how much data collected
				- No mention of methodology
				- No wordlists or examples
				- ONLY results
					- -> maybe not worth spending TOO much time on these
			- **More worthwhile as theoretical discussions in the early chapters, and as a foundation for where we are today**
		- Evans et al 2009-present
			- Discussion of the changing of the genetic categories provided in [[Evans et al 2017]] and other works due here. 
				- Requires an understanding of the previous classification "Morehead-Upper Maro family"
	- Genetic affiliation
		- wordlists and sound correspondences
		- refer to [[Wurm 1975]] here, as well as Ross and more recent sources
	- [[Palmer 2017]] "Languages and Linguistics of the New Guinea Area" has a number of pertinent chapters
		- 1. language families of the new guinea area
		- 2. the TNG family
		- 8. Morphosyntactic typology of Papuan languages
	- Also a section on anthropological works? A quick mention?
- The setting and the speakers
	- An important section not typical to phds in general
- This Project
	- Covers the Core section
		- Research design
		- Proposals
		- Results
			- Typological overview


- there are some questions I have after writing [[Assessment]] 3 for LING9032
	- I should identify characteristics of the TNG family that exclude Yam languages
		- Likely described by [[Ross 2005]], and maybe elsewhere in that volume
		- Also described by Evans somewhere
		- Also in the 'Languages and Linguistics of the New Guinea area' book (described above), the chapter on the TNG family
	- I need to describe the grouping by Wurm and them, and show what it is based on (cognates and something else, shared grammatical structures?) 
	- Is this a chapter to include comparative wordlists from my data and that of [[Riley & Ray 1930]] and [[Williams 1936]]? 

- -> Sources I've found but haven't included in Assignment 3 or my CoC written
	- Lyons 1914 - Report on BNG contains wordlists from the languages spoken between the Wassi Kussa and the Dutch border
	- Hammarstrom 2009 and Donohue 2008 on counting systems in the morehead district
	- Lean 1991 on counting systems in New Guinea
		- need to review this to see if it really mentions Namo/Dorro
