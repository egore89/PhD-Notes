- /kəɳɖon/ 'inside' appears to become /kəɳɖot/ in the phrase "let's go into the house" (inside the house?). Recording 20130920-E number 8, 10

- in the phrase "(noun) is coming" what does /kəʃ/ mean? 20130920-E annotations 15-
	- 'jimmy kəʃ jennəm' jimmy is coming
	- 'ʈømbio ær kəʃ enre' two men are coming
		- -> it appears it can be dropped. annot. 17

- in 20130920-E annotation number 23 F1 seems to say '/fojo/' is 'enough', while discussing the word for 'stop'.

- what does /ʃi ʃot/ mean? Eniam (F1) and others seem to say this a lot when talking to people (maybe giving instructions)
	- ?/ʃi/ means language, and /ʃot/ means bone?

- 'stop' /aβraŋgo/ ends in an /o/ but this is dropped in imperative dual
	- -> /k-aβraŋg-end/
	- -> a morphophonemic rule? [[Phonology]]
- this same occurs in the plural of this paradigm, except with the plural suffix which appears to be /-angi/ but here is /-ngi/

- in 20130920-E annotation 25 Eniam gives /norjan/ as a suggestion for 'I'm trying to stop' (? instead of /nuβŋgon/)
	- -> c.f. [[Nick 04.2.25]] where he states 'talk and do' are the same verb in Nen
		- -> /norjan/ is given as 'speak' in 20130920-H annot. 24
- -> I'm not saying that /norjan/ should be used in the case of 'I'm trying to stop' but it seems like this confirms what Nick said that 'talk' and 'do' are the same word.
	- -> could be a useful elicitation tool

- in 20130920-E annotation 60 we see 'I am swimming' as /jənd ɸəʃau nakmetan/, where /ɸəʃau/ is given as 'swim(ming)'. 
	- -> what does /nakmetan/ do here?
	- Is it related to the examples in 20130920-F for 'burning' given as /nakrne/
		- -> so the stem is /nak-/ followed by suffixes? 
			- /-an/ is 1.sg, I believe.
