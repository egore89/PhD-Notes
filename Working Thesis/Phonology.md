- a specific example:
	-  /aisa-ð/ "to ascend"
	- I'm calling the second vowel /a/ instead of schwa because of how this word becomes other forms, viz:
		- /knaisa/ "ascend.IMP" (instead of \*/knais/ if this was an inserted vowel)
		- /jnd nngaisan/ "I am going up" (instead of \*/nngaisn/ if this was an inserted vowel)
	- This could also be an example of a low-mid vowel like /ɐ/, but I'll need more evidence from other words that this vowel exists before I start down that road.
	- Need to grapple with the fact that this sounds VERY central in a lot of tokens. C.f. 20130920-E number 009.

- I'm going to need to re-listen to the recordings when it comes time to talk about prosody, stress, emphasis


- 'dropped' vowels introduced in [[Lexicon]]
	-  'stop' /aβraŋgo-/ ends in an /o/ but this is dropped in imperative dual
		- -> /k-aβraŋg-end/
		- this same occurs in the plural of this paradigm, except with the plural suffix which appears to be /-angi/ but here is /-ngi/
	- 'exit' /ator-/ with the venitive directional prefix /n-/ in the imperative
		- -> /ator-/ becomes /ɸəm k-ator/ 'you go out' 
		- -> but /ɸəm k-n-tor/ 'you come out' and with other directional prefixes

- what is the status of /z/ and /nz/ and /s/ and /ʃ/ in related languages?
	- this could be an interesting thing about Namo, yet another reason to investigate
		- Is this sound change in progress? What evidence could there already be for or against this hypothesis? [[Confirmation Of Candidature]]
