Usually each is compartmentalised to certain scenarios or situations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                         |
| Inchoative                 | A name for a construction or a verb, and is also called *inceptive*. These verbs/constructions mark the beginning of the following/modified verb (action). In English this can be an inflected form of "start", for example with either a present participle or the infinitive of the modified verb. In Nama, for another example, this occurs as the modified verb with the nominaliser suffix /-gh/, followed by the fully inflected form of "start", including tense, aspect, and person markings. | [[Siegel 2023]]         |
| Preterite                  | Completed past actions.

| Hodiernal                  | Refers to things that happen on the day being talked about. Some languages use hodiernal events in the present tense. Some distinguish between hodiernal and non-hodiernal past/future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                         |
| Non-configurational        | A typological category that seems to refer to languages with relatively free word order, e.g. Warlpiri (also Marori). The specifics have to do with Generative Theory and how that framework handles movement of words within a fairly rigid understanding of syntactic word order (like wh-movement? and also PRO-drop languages).                                                                                                                                                                   |                         |

| Solipsism                  | Self centred, or perhaps restricted by a narrow view or sample size.
