I need a note space to write out my thoughts in an unstructured, random place. Maybe later I can add structure


## General Thoughts

- A debate I can engage with in the background of my thesis is the idea of "framework-free description" versus using "basic linguistic theory"; haspelmath vs dixon. Synthesising both sides, which I think involves describing how they're saying the same thing while pretending they're arguing. 

- Is it best to read sources chronologically? Start with sources from the 19th century then work my way through to now? Because that's not what I'm doing. Or is it better to start with now and work back, holding space for where we are while I see where we come from? Because I'm also not doing that.
	- Bouncing around doesn't feel right either. But maybe the problem is wanting to "feel right".
#### Fries & Pike 1949 Coexistent phonemic systems
- This is a single description covering numerous dialectal variants' phonology. Reading as a sample of how this might be done, and maybe for some curious further sources

- Nichols 1986 is another "seminal" text on a linguistic topic.
- "The speech of monolingual natives of some languages is comprised of more than one phonemic system". p. 29
	- One interesting example here is that phonemes may appear differently in words of native origin versus loan words. 
		- This has really interesting implications for Yam languages and Namo, since speakers are so multilingual. 
	- Examples given from Mazateco, presumably from south America, where a native phonology would consider \[t] and \[d] as allophones due to complementary distributions, but this is only seen in native words. In loans from Spanish, the difference becomes phonemic.
		- Considering also the case of voiced palatal fricatives in English.
		- Consider the case of Icelandic dental fricatives also where kaþólskur may be the only word where "þ" occurs word medially
			- assuming words like "ennþá" are considered combinations of "enn" + "þá"
- "Should one or two loan words be considered strong enough to break the occurrences of /t/ into two phonemes, /t/ and /d/? The analyst might easily reply in the affirmative..."p. 30
	-  **were it not for a fact of a nondistributional kind: the monolingual natives referred to, as well as the bilinguals, find it easier to learn to read \[nd] when it is written 'nt' than when it is written 'nd'.** 
		- Is this saying that the evidence that these are two phonemes not allophones comes from responses to written language?
- "In a purely descriptive analysis of a dialect of a monolingual speaker there are no loans discoverable or describable." p. 31
	- "Dialect mixture cannot be studied or legitimately affirmed to exist unless two systems have previously been studied separately." Perhaps support for describing many varieties of a language family, particularly one where "loans" are frequent.
