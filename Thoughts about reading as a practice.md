# General thoughts

- There's a lot of standards and expectations inside me about reading. "I can't spend hours and hours reading." "Why aren't you doing something more useful?" "Why aren't you reading something more useful?" This "never being good enough" is a problem. 
	- What's the solution though? Exposure? Spending time reading something while freaking out that I "should" be doing something else? I won't read a sentence. 


# The importance of reading to expand knowledge

I found this PDF on Google and it seems interesting. I don't know how sophisticated or well this is written, but the text has stimulated some thinking in me. Going to take some notes here.

- Information gleaned from reading can include entertainment
- Reading is not only a process of remembering, but also a mental work process that involves aspects of critical and creative thinking. 
	- I wonder if maybe what people mean when they say "reading is my hobby" is more than just passively reading the words, but perhaps they take notes and sit and think critically with the text as well. So what I've been doing as "reading" is only part of the process of the "hobby" of "reading".
- Reading goals should meet two conditions:
	- clear and precise terms for what to look for
	- a picture of what the reading should accomplish
		- "what one should be able to do after reading".
